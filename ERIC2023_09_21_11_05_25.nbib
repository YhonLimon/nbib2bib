AB  - This study investigates teachers' perceptions of school democracy within a low-stakes accountability context. While previous studies have focused on teachers' perceptions of school climate and citizenship norms, we know less about factors associated with their perceptions of democracy in their schools. Through a multiple regression analysis of survey data, we investigated possible predictors of teachers' perceptions regarding their schools' democratic character within Norway's low-stakes accountability system. In this study, theories on professionalism and educational and democratic leadership serve as an overarching framework. Results suggest a positive relationship between teachers' experience of trust, support, and an inclusive relationship with their principal/leadership team and perceptions of democratic features in their school. Moreover, the higher the importance teachers place on teaching skills and values related to democracy, the more democratic they perceive their schools to be. Finally, findings indicate that education for democracy is embedded in collaboration structures at the school level.

AB  - This article is the first of four articles exploring democratic schools co-founded by teenage students in Norway and Sweden. Our larger project explores the relationship between democracy in education and educational dialogism. Both democracy in education and educational dialogism are partially rooted in the idea that education should be a personal meaning-making practice where the participants can create and organize their lives in ways that make sense to them and explore their interests, values, and desires. We describe the processes of founding two schools--one in Oslo, Norway, and the other in Gothenburg, Sweden--in which students practiced the right to democratic governance. We describe the process of the founding of these schools against the background of the students' movements in the late 1960s and the 1970s and the social and political conditions in Norway and Sweden at that time. We explore the students' perspectives on the possibility, desirability, and legitimacy of the students' voices in ethical-ontological dialogues in which the participants jointly examine their relationships with the world, with others, and with themselves. Further, we explore the forms of democratic school governance that Norwegian and Swedish students created and identified tensions that appeared between the legitimacy of individual students' rights to ownership of their learning, teachers' ownership of teaching, and the conventional normative educational policies in Norway and Sweden.

AB  - The aim of the research is to reveal opinions of prospective teachers on democratic education and democratic behaviors of teaching staff at the universities, based on opinions of both university prospective teachers and teaching staff. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used together. The sample of the study consists of 37 teaching staff and 152 senior students at the departments of Primary School Education, Science Education, Religious Culture and Ethics Education. To articulate the prospective teachers' opinions about democracy and democratic education, a semi-structured interview form and a questionnaire were developed to see their self-efficacy. The "Democratic Classroom Management Scale" was used to collect data for self-evaluation of the teaching staff's democratic behavior in the classroom. It was also adapted for the prospective teachers. Content analysis technique was used in analysis of the qualitative data. SPSS package program was used in analysis of quantitative data. In addition to frequency and percentage calculations, t test and ANOVA analyses were made. The study showed that the teaching staff considers their classroom practices democratic. However, the prospective teachers perceive the teaching staff moderately democratic. They, however, believe that they will grasp highly democratic attitudes in the class when they begin to teach.

AB  - Purpose: We discuss and preliminarily evaluate the SCA, a novel educational experiment that takes place in a Greek high school. Drawing on contemporary educational and political theory as well as the rich history of democratic ideas SCA has a twofold aim: to enable students to substantially participate in direct democratic decision-making procedures and to engage them along with their teachers in democratic school governance. Design/methodology/approach: SCA operates under conditions of democratic equality and mutual respect, since all students and teachers have one vote and the same speech rights, and its decisions are binding for the school community. The preliminary results that SCA has yielded so far, are based on the systematic observation of the SCA proceedings and on a structured self-report questionnaire for students. Findings: SCA promotes democratic school governance, improves the school's social climate, contributes to the development of certain democratic attitudes and skills, and helps students to become more responsible and public-spirited citizens.

AB  - Amid hyper-partisanship, increasing critiques of civic education reform priorities from conservatives, and growing signs of democratic backsliding, can schools provide foundational support for democratic norms, commitments, and capacities? Drawing on a unique national survey of high school principals conducted in 2018, we examine how political context, district priorities, and principal beliefs and characteristics are related to support for civic education. We find that a school's partisan context is unrelated to most supports for democratic education. Of note, however, support for the discussion of controversial issues is less common in conservative districts, raising important questions about why the discussion of controversial issues (a core building block of democratic societies) is less common in conservative settings. In addition, support for civic education at the school level is highest at schools led by principals who are civically active and in districts that are committed to democratic aims. At a time when school districts face highly contentious politics, these findings indicate that systemic district commitments can help strengthen our civic foundations and that principals and district leaders may be able to promote small-d democracy amid increasingly politicized school governance contexts.

AB  - In bringing together the literature on post-democracy and theoretical work on the politics of affective societies, this article explores how democratic education might benefit from a sustained examination of negative emotions and affects associated with democratic disenchantment. In particular, the analysis highlights what is gained by introducing a more pedagogically and politically robust approach toward 'ugly' and 'negative' feelings in the context of democratic education in schools, namely, a pedagogical approach that recognizes the gloomy ramifications of post-democracy in the daily life of teachers and young people and inspires transformative action that contributes toward practical 'democratic innovations' in the sphere of civil society. This article contributes toward ongoing efforts for the renewal of democratic education in schools by urging teachers and researchers to rethink pedagogically how to navigate productively the ugly and negative feelings of democratic disenchantment.

AB  - Background/Context: Social scientists, policymakers, and commentators have long assumed that Western democracies enjoy relative stability because of deep commitments to a culture of democratic governance. But those commitments are quickly fading in almost every developed and developing democracy around the globe. In the same period in which support for democracy has declined, schools and teacher education programs have been pressured by "accountability" measures and economic austerity to focus on math and literacy achievement to the exclusion of nearly every other educational goal. These challenges to social cohesion and democratic governance highlight the need for young people to be exposed early on and throughout their educational pathways to the knowledge, skills, and dispositions consistent with democratic life. The narrowing of curricular goals, therefore, is a threat to the stability of democratic institutions. Purpose: This essay examines the potential of teacher education as a lever for change. How might teacher educators ensure that teachers are prepared to foster education that will sustain and strengthen democratic norms? If schools have an essential role to play in preparing students for informed engagement in civic and political life, how can we best prepare teachers to advance those goals? Research Design: This is an analytical essay drawing on recent empirical research on declining support for democratic values and on teachers' civic engagement as well as conceptual work on democratic education goals. To illustrate the potential for teacher education to prepare teachers to engage students in political issues discussions, I draw on data from the first large-scale empirical study of what U.S. high school teachers currently do to prepare youth to understand economic inequality and its causes, effects, and possible remedies. The study included a teacher survey and follow-up interviews concerning teachers' political ideology and civic and political engagement as well as classroom practice. The 2,750 teachers who participated in the survey are representative of U.S. public schools (and an additional segment of U.S. elite independent schools) in terms of student demographics and geographic location. We also conducted 150 follow-up interviews. Conclusions/Recommendations: I suggest that teacher education must move from reactive technocratic concerns for accountability and standardization to broader civic and civil commitments to the foundations of democratic community, pluralism, and relationship. Teacher education programs should consider ways to encourage new and experienced teachers to follow the news, engage in civil discourse with one another about topics of public concern, and participate in civic and political life. Moreover, teacher educators could work toward teaching the knowledge, skills, and dispositions associated with political and civic engagement.

AB  - Democratic society, which is developing in the Republic of Croatia, has aspired for a flexible and developmental curriculum oriented towards the individualization of the educational process, cooperation of all participants and positive communication. Such curriculum is enhanced by pedagogical documentation of the educational process, constructive dialogue, and critical reflection on continuous reflective practicums of educators. The outcome of such professional development of educators is the gradual equalization of democratic values in a stimulating learning context. The qualitative approach to the pedagogical practice of the early education curriculum has been changed and improved in three periods of research by action research through ethnographic records. The research was conducted in a Croatian kindergarten, and the results confirm the need to use pedagogical documentation, continuous and honest discussions of educators during which the democratic dialogue raises the level of professional development of educators, and consequently the development of democratic values in children.

AB  - Democratic classroom practices are all strategies adopted by classroom teachers to actively engage students in the learning processes. Considerable literature assessing influence of Civic Education on youths' active participation in a democratic society exists. Not much have reported an empirically conducted study on classroom best practices adopted by Civic Education teachers in the Global South. This paper examines classroom democratization by Civic Education teachers in South East Nigeria, students' and teachers' perceptions of democratic classroom, and challenges confronting classroom democratization. Focus Group Discussion and Democratic classroom questionnaire were used to elicit information from 151 civic education teachers and 1400 senior secondary school one (SS1) students. Findings revealed that Civic Education teachers in South East Nigeria adopted democratic classroom practices marginally. Recommendation includes more adoption of democratic classroom best practices for development of students' critical thinking abilities, preparing them to become participatory in their civic duties and reducing crimes among today's youths.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the phenomena of participation in a democratic large ensemble experience in a secondary public school setting. Specific research questions included (a) Do high school band students feel capable of performing a music work without teacher intervention? (b) In what ways do high school band students describe the experience of performing in a student-led large ensemble? (c) What music decisions were most often made by high school band students in a student-led large ensemble? and (d) Were there any changes in high school students' perceptions of autonomy following a student-led large ensemble music rehearsal and performance experience? Findings illustrated that the democratic experience increased student autonomy and music discrimination across larger distances in the classroom as students listened to other nonsimilar sections. Furthermore, student voice, self-efficacy, and personal affect also increased as a result of the experience. Students felt empowered to offer their rehearsal critiques; however, a lingering concern is that participants continued to feel that their peers would not listen to their opinions on rehearsal issues or strategy usage.

AB  - The popular discourse of democratic education is home to numerous myths surrounding our conceptions of what inclusion means in today's schools. Certain beliefs like the idea that offering equal opportunities for participation to all students regardless of individual need, which conflates equality and equity, or that democracy in classrooms involves nothing more than limitless inclusion are upheld as go-to solutions for the inevitable dilemmas for educators committed to inclusion. This paper argues that philosophical clarification of the concept of inclusion is urgently required by teachers, policy makers, and theorists of education committed to both democracy in education and democratic education. Our most urgent concern is related to the inherent attitude toward deficit implied by different understandings of inclusion. This is not necessarily due to the unclarities and ambiguities associated with the concept itself, but rather reflect the calculated and anticipatory way educators tend to approach classroom practice. We argue that with careful philosophical clarification, along with an entirely new stance on the part of teachers regarding their pedagogical practice and a reconceptualized notion of student 'needs,' the concept of inclusion can continue to remain not only useful but essential to creating a robust democratic community in the classroom.

AB  - Background/Context: Almost 100 years ago, John Dewey advocated for a democratic U.S. educational system, one that echoed the tenets of the U.S. Constitution and achieved an ethical ideal by inviting participation of all students. Yet the U.S. educational system continues to stop short of this goal insofar as students of Color--especially those in urban school districts--disproportionately face obstacles not so encountered by white students. Purpose/Focus of Study: If democracy in the United States is characterized by freedom, equality, and liberty, the inherent question is whether these rights are enjoyed in equivalent degrees among all citizens against the context of white nationalist marches, police brutality, racially targeted mass shootings, and racial bias in education and society. Setting: Despite historical strides in civil rights, today's United States has become increasingly racialized and--some would argue--indicative of a neo-fascist climate wherein whiteness and white supremacy prevail. Subjects: How does this racial tension manifest in teacher education, a field in which racialized whiteness is already so "overwhelming" and most teacher candidates are white? What is the current state of "democratic" education in the United States given the historical bias against students of Color? Can schools, educators, and advocates achieve Dewey's democratic ideal? Research Design: Using critical race theory and critical studies of whiteness, we theoretically explore a new "constitution" for the state of education, specifically teacher education, in today's climate to posit whether democratic education can truly exist in the midst of systemic racism. Conclusion/Recommendations: We consider examples from within both teacher education and U.S. society writ large to show associations among attitudes, dispositions, and ideologies as aligned with racialized whiteness and then offer more just recommendations for educators attempting to resist racism in order to create a more democratic educational space.

AB  - Background/Context: Considered one of the most influential educators in Brazil's history, Anísio Teixeira is one of the renowned Latin American students who came to Teachers College (TC). Teixeira was a prominent reformer and educator known for advocating free, public, and secular education accessible to all children. His work as an educator and policy maker is closely related to the idea that schools are "machines that generate democracy." Purpose/Objective: The article discusses how Teixeira's education at Teachers College and his experiences within the U.S. schooling system shaped his conceptions of education and influenced how he aimed to reform the Brazilian public school. Research Design: The study is a historical analysis based on archival research and the works published by Teixeira on education and democracy. Conclusions: Brazil and the United States' historical moment influenced how Anísio Teixeira lived his personal and academic experiences at Teachers College. While discussions on society and education in his home country revolved around establishing a new model, Teachers College welcomed international students who could promote values based on the example offered by the United States. The combination of those perspectives impacted how Teixeira perceived the centrality of democratic values on schooling practices and considered them central for the reforms he would implement upon returning to Brazil.

AB  - Democratic education focuses on developing students using democratic principles and processes in the classroom. In this study, we aim to understand how self-identified democratic educators practice democratic education in public-school classrooms. Nine participants, teachers in K12 schools, were interviewed for this qualitative study. In investigating how public-school teachers implemented and sustained democratic education in their classrooms, six themes emerged--fostering relationships, empowering students, and teaching and using democratic skills, democratic educative structure, democratic teacher praxis, and obstacles.

AB  - Background/Context: In this article, we draw on Villegas's explanations of beliefs as precursors to social justice dispositions and Mills et al.'s Australian research about social justice dispositions as either affirmative or transformative. These conceptual positions assist us in understanding the beliefs that are derived from applicants' schooling and life experiences. Purpose of Study: The article reports on how 46 candidates applying for an Australian equity-oriented initial teacher education (ITE) program described their backgrounds and beliefs around social justice. The purpose of the research is to understand starting point beliefs in order to design a strongly democratic teacher education program for historically hard-to-staff schools. Setting: Expressions of interest were analyzed from applications to an Australian ITE program designed to prepare teachers for hard-to-staff urban and rural secondary schools in Victoria, Australia. Research Design: This research is a qualitative critical discourse analysis. Our initial activity involved grouping statements using the following five codes: their firsthand, personal backgrounds of disadvantage; their secondhand experience with disadvantage, such as seeing racism from afar or volunteering; their belief statements about equity or social justice; their deficit positions or stereotypes; and their overtly activist statements. Findings/Results: Finding that some of these discourses were much more common than others, we were able to examine applicants' social justice discourses more deeply. We contend that democratic discourses can be seen on a kind of continuum, with weaker (or thinner) and stronger versions. In general, a weaker version of equity includes generic inclusive beliefs about everyone being equal, whereas a stronger version demonstrates a more complex understanding of social inequities and a commitment to changing systems rather than individuals. Within each category, there were glimpses of weaker and stronger activist experiences and beliefs that we consider precursors to strong social justice or democratic teacher dispositions. Conclusions/Recommendations: Rather than determining selection into the program, the candidates' social justice statements made in their expressions of interest (EOIs) became starting points to design a program that prepares teachers who are knowledgeable agents of social change. Their statements guided us to understand these starting points in relation to how the candidates narrated their backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs, and enabled us to better explore how social justice is interpreted.

AB  - The number of studies that evaluate and discuss the concepts of democracy and social justice in Turkey from the perspective teacher training, education policies and practices is extremely limited. Thus, the present study attempts to determine democratic attitudes and social justice beliefs of preservice teachers and whether these variables differ based on gender, age, family income level, and parental education level variables. The present study also aims to test the relation between the democratic attitudes and social justice beliefs of pre-service teachers using structural equation model. 483 pre-service teachers were included in the study sample. According to the study findings, it was concluded that democratic attitudes and social justice beliefs of pre-service teachers are medium level and these variables does not differ based on demographic variables. It was also identified that the democratic attitudes of pre-service teachers are significant determinant of their social justice beliefs. The concepts of democracy and social justice were discussed in depth as regards teacher education policies, programs and practices, and recommendations are provided for future implications.

AB  - This study aims to comparatively analyze the effect size of perceptions related to democratic attitudes and values of school administrators, teachers, preservice teachers, and students. The meta-analysis method, one of the research synthesis methods, was used in the research. Within the scope of the study, master's and doctoral theses and research articles dealing with this topic in Turkey were investigated. Based on the screening results, a total of 101 studies from 2013 to 2020 abided by the inclusion criteria. For these 101 studies comprising a sample of 33,774 people, four effect sizes were calculated. According to research results, high levels of effect size were determined based on the random effect model for opinions related to democratic attitudes and values of school administrators, teachers, preservice teachers, and students (d=41.14). The perceptions of democratic attitudes and values of participants were ranked from low to high as students (d=30.45), school administrators (d=38.66), teachers (d=47.86), and preservice teachers (d=51.73). There was a significant difference between the opinions of participants (p=0.00). Students appeared to have the lowest perceptions of democratic attitudes and values. According to the results of moderator analysis, the effect sizes of studies were determined to differ depending on publication type (p=0.00), educational level (p=0.00), gender of the researcher (p=0.00), and the region of the research (p=0.00). Concerning the meta-regression results for the effect size in terms of the year the research was performed, there appeared to be a falling trend in perceptions related to democratic attitudes and values of participants.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the views on democratic school culture in schools and provide a conceptual framework for democratic school culture. The sample of the study, which used a descriptive survey design, consisted of 516 primary school and 378 secondary school students, 592 school administrators/teachers, and 609 parents of students from pilot and volunteering schools in 10 provinces in Turkey within the scope of "Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education Project" (Edirne, Elazig, Istanbul, Konya, Manisa, Mardin, Sakarya, Mersin, Samsun, Yozgat).Data were collected using "Democratic School Culture Scales" developed in the project. The data collected were evaluated under five dimensions: (1) Communication, Interaction, and Cooperation, (2) School and Learning Environment, (3) Identity and Belonging, (4) Responsibility, and (5) Decision-making Process. According to the opinions of students, administrators-teachers and parents, it was identified that there was medium and high level democratic school culture in the schools. It was concluded that the project made a contribution in this sense. Teachers, administrators and parents had high mean scores in communication, interaction and collaboration dimensions and students had high mean scores in identity, sense of belonging, and responsibility dimensions Significant differences were found in the democratic school culture dimensions in terms of education level and type of duty. We recommend that new activities and training programs be designed for areas in need of development, to create and sustain a democratic school culture.

AB  - Democracy is highlighted in the Norwegian school system. This article investigates how pre-service teachers in social studies understand the more theoretical concept of democracy, and in what ways they intend to operationalize it with future pupils. Three ideal types are used to locate perspectives in the data: pure liberalist, majority rule and deliberative models of democracy. The findings indicate that perceptions of democracy in the sample are most commonly associated with core aspects of liberal democracy through a general focus on elections and voting, majority rule and individual civil liberties. A striking finding is the highly apparent internalization of participation as a norm and ideal in itself. However, ideas of contents and didactical implications of participation varies among respondents. As many also display a seemingly restricted interpretation of the political sphere, this might imply a thin understanding of democratic participation. The article further points out that translating concepts from political science into pedagogical notions is not a straightforward endeavor.

AB  - This research was undertaken to better understand how the teaching of high school history contributes to citizenship education in Turkey. To achieve this goal, we focused on two main research questions. First, what does the history curriculum in Turkey include regarding citizenship education? Second, what do history educators think about contributing to citizenship education? Phenomenology, one of the qualitative research designs, was applied while seeking the answers to these research questions. Data diversity was ensured, and the history curriculum was analyzed in the first stage of the study. In the second stage, using a semi-structured interview protocol, interviews were conducted with history educators as the relevant curriculum implementers and the findings were examined using content analysis. It was found that the relationship between citizenship and history education is mainly centered on national identity construction. History courses promote democratic and global citizenship to a very limited extent, and, for a variety of reasons, the high school history curriculum of Turkey falls short of achieving the objectives of democratic citizenship education.

AB  - This study reports on Greek in-service primary school teachers' perceptions of inclusive education and the extent to which those perceptions are associated with democratic beliefs about classroom life. In addition to examining general perceptions of inclusion, this study examines the association of teachers' democratic beliefs about classroom life with specific perceptions of inclusive education, including sentiments, attitudes, and concerns. Finally, this study investigates the extent to which teachers' perceptions of inclusive education are associated with key demographic, professional, and personal characteristics. The sample consisted of 315 primary school teachers in Greece who completed a) the 'Sentiments, Attitudes, and Concerns about Inclusive Education Revised' Scale and b) the 'Democratic Teacher Belief Scale'. Results indicate that participants had moderately positive views about inclusive education. Teachers' democratic beliefs about classroom life were significantly associated with their attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusive education. Significant associations were found between teachers' perceptions of inclusive education and their perceived confidence in teaching students with disabilities, training in disabilities education, and prior experience in teaching students with disabilities. The findings are discussed in relation to their implications for teachers' training programs in countries and educational systems that are at an early stage of providing inclusive education.

AB  - Collaborations between public schools and non-system actors (NSAs) raise questions regarding the influence of such external partners. Focusing on the case of civic education, this study asks how such cross-sector alliances (CSAs) impact the citizenship conceptions promoted in Israeli classrooms. Thirty-two interviews were conducted with teachers engaged in such collaborations. The findings point to the influences of NSAs civic ideology, and its relation to the state's civics curriculum standards, on the citizenship conceptions enacted in each case. Four distinct approaches to CSAs were identified: (1) alignment; (2) complementary; (3) reduction; and (4) alternative. Based on Dewey's fundamental understandings of the essence of democracy, we question the assumption that CSAs will present a multifaceted approach and a critical stance toward citizenship. We contend that in the three approaches, aside from the alternative approach, collaborations serve society's dominant hegemonic groups by maintaining power relations.

AB  - One of the aims at Albalqa Applied University is to prepare the student to contribute positively in society so the main important goal of the comprehensive reform of the education system in Jordan is to contribute to the democratic development of the country. The study has been investigated to find out if the English instructors adopt the democracy techniques in their classes. This paper presents a classroom management model to be used in teaching English by having English teachers use the democratic process to create their English learning environments. The researcher prepared a "Democracy Scale" about the extent of applying democratization in EFL environment at universities as data collection tool. The sample was randomly chosen from Al-Balqa' Applied University. The study suggested several implications like using technology inside EFL environment and conducting a similar study to know students perspectives about practicing democracy in the EFL environment.

AB  - In pursuit of preparing social justice educators, the authors argue for the inclusion of young adolescents and teacher candidates as "boundary-spanning teacher educators" who are both contributors to and recipients of professional knowledge and learning. The authors draw from a qualitative, longitudinal study on the impact of a partnership between a university and local school district to assert that excluding youth, teacher candidates, and other school personnel from recognition as teacher educators is counter to ideas characterizing democratic education. In keeping with that assertion, the authors center the voices of teacher candidates and young adolescents to present pedagogical strategies that embody democratic principles. Implications for teacher preparation program design are discussed, with particular focus on middle grades education.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the cognitive constructs of teachers on democratic education in schools. For this purpose, the study was modelled as a case study. The study group was 20 teachers and determined by using maximum variation sampling method. Repertory grid technique was used to collect data. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis technique. The participants produced 200 valid cognitive constructs related to the democratic education in school. The most frequently mentioned cognitive constructs were respectively: (1) motivation increases, (2) confidence/self-confidence, (3) job satisfaction increases, (4) tolerance, (5) participative management, (6) employees feel precious, (7) organisational commitment, (8) new opinions, (9) human rights, and (10) freedom of ideas/impressions. The cognitive constructs were classified considering functionality and the similarity of them. As a result of classification, 14 main groups were determined according to the 200 valid cognitive constructs. Democratic participation should be encouraged by the school administrators. Besides, school society should display democratic attitudes for democratic education. In addition, the school administrators should appreciate students, teachers and parents in terms of success of school they manage.

AB  - This article proposes that the scope for parental involvement is limited in the current Swedish school system, despite its claim to the highest level of democracy and its extensive marketisation and juridification. In order to define this deficit, we introduce the notion of democratic parental involvement. We further trace the history of the pronounced reluctance towards parents seeking to influence the education of their children in Swedish education policy since the 1940s. Three characteristic ideas in this policy are highlighted: (1) its concept of 'democratic education'; (2) the idea of 'the best interest of the child'; and (3) the concept of 'the professional teacher'. We argue that these strands together make the idea of democratic parental involvement being a positive force in education virtually inconceivable.

AB  - This study aims to determine the relationship between the levels of work stress and the democratic perceptions of principals and teachers. The research was conducted in public schools located in Isparta. Correlational research design is followed. Interestingly, participants' perceptions of accountability for their superiors significantly predict the job stress levels of administrators and teachers positively. This can be interpreted as the perception of accountability increases, job stress increases. The fact that principals and teachers are supervised frequently by their managers, who gives importance to accountability, may cause pressure them. Additionally, it was observed that the perception of justice and equality significantly predicted the stress levels of teachers and administrators negatively. This finding can be interpreted that the increase in the fair attitude of the managers towards the employees and demonstrating equal behaviors cause a lower level of work stress. Moreover, the gender of principals and teachers predicted work stress significantly. It was determined that male participants' perception of job stress was higher than female participants. However, the seniority of administrators and teachers did not significantly predict the perception of work stress. Finally, the transparency and participation dimension of the organizational democracy did not significantly predict the job stress levels of administrators and teachers. This may be a result of a centralized organizational structure. Based on the research findings, recommendations were given to reduce the work stress experienced by principals and teachers and develop a culture of democracy in educational organizations.

AB  - Today, the COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for a more democratic climate in K-12 schools. Administrators and teachers have had to seek out new ways through which to interact. This raises two questions; "What about the quality of interaction and participation in decision-making?" and "Which factors affect the level of participation in decision-making?" The aim of the current research is to determine the factors that predict the applicability level of e-democracy (i.e., "reporting and declaring opinions" and "decision-making") in K-12 schools. An associational research design was used in order to attain the main goal of the study, with Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) technique used to analyze the factors predicting the applicability level of e-democracy. Data were collected from a total of 765 inservice K-12 teachers through a questionnaire developed by the researchers. DFA results showed "motivation to participate," "the level of participatory democracy in the country," and higher levels of the "use of Twitter" as the significant determinants of different levels of e-democracy application. Moreover, the results also indicated that those participants with the belief of e-democracy's applicability at the decision-making level found the "motivation level of stakeholders" to be the most critical. Their level of Twitter use was higher. They also believed that the level of participatory democracy in the country was at a higher level. Another result of the DFA pointed to "security and ethical issues," and lower levels of the "use of Twitter" as factors differentiating the group believing that e-democracy can be applicable with reporting and the declaration of opinions to administrators from the other groups. The discussions highlighted the critical role of participation level in e-democracy within K-12 schools.

AB  - This article presents a mixed method study on how to develop a participatory education management model as an alternative to the Turkish education administration system. Consisting of qualitative and quantitative methods, the mixed research method has been adopted to acquire the required data. Qualitative phase the education administration systems applied in OECD member countries, documents and reports available in the literature were evaluated. To reach wider masses, an online survey aiming at collecting the views of teachers and administrators was carried out by using the quantitative phase of the mixed method. This study has laid it bare that the principles of good governance, common sense, transparency, accountability, participation, democracy, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability stand forefront in educational systems that adopt the participatory education boards model. Eventually, a board/commission oriented local education administration model has been designed and developed as an alternative for the Turkish educational administration system.

AB  - Speaking to the political and social upheaval of our present moment, and drawing on discourses of democratic education, we argue that the U.S.'s racial reckoning propelled by recent events constitutes a sort of "founding" for our democracy and that this founding has important implications for reconfiguring citizenship within institutions and practices of teacher education. In building this argument, we articulate the aims of teacher education in a democracy and expand upon political scientist Danielle Allen's theoretical concepts of "sacrifice," "reconstitution," and "wholeness," demonstrating their urgent utility within our "thinning" democracy (Hess & McAvoy, 2015). We then draw on relevant literature to examine how teacher education fits into this larger political landscape, and we identify three monumental challenges within the field. Finally, we offer a way forward for teacher education, one grounded in democratic principles and centered on Allen's conceptualization of wholeness.

AB  - Philosophy for Democracy is a research project which aims to examine whether and how Philosophy with Children contributes to the development of democratic skills and attitudes. Philosophy with Children seeks to develop children's critical thinking, their ability to judge, enhance their dialogical skills and attitudes and to contribute to their dealing with differences. These are important competencies for a citizen in a democratic society. In this study we enquire these aims in four primary schools. We have used Goodlad's curriculum model. In this model, a curriculum is divided into six levels: the underlying view or rationale; manuals and other resources; the interpretation by the teacher; the operationalisation in classroom; the experiences of the children and the results of the curriculum. At each of these levels we have enquired Philosophy with Children in relation to democratic education.

AB  - This article is an exploration of a democratic school where the author spent several years researching and engaging with teachers and students while investigating the practice of Philosophy for/with Children (P4C) within Irish Educate Together schools. I offer an account of how teachers in these contexts seek to reconcile and harmonise their P4C practice with their own educational and democratic outlooks. These perspectives were uncovered through a 'lived enquiry' study involving deep immersion in the day-to-day life of a school as a researcher and P4C practitioner. Teachers seeking to reconcile their practice with their views in this context resulted in the children in their classrooms learning through democratic processes, where democracy is not merely prescribed, but instead becomes a way of life. By drawing upon excerpts of teacher interview data from my doctoral studies, I suggest that there is a 'rough ground' of practice where diverse and unique perspectives can be revealed when lived, deeply immersive and sensitive approaches are taken towards practitioners and their communities. The intertwining of Educate Together and P4C philosophies of education is explored, with particular emphasis on the notion of child-centredness, dialogue and philosophical enquiry with children. Expanding on the democratic educational ideas of Biesta and Fielding, I argue that there is a deeply contextual and philosophically compelling connection between teachers engaging in P4C, the atmosphere or environment in which dialogue with children can occur and a different understanding of democracy through education that may result.

AB  - The present empirical study seeks to explore the perceptions novice educators have toward the use of controversial public issues (CPI) in the secondary classroom. The research attempts to do this by examining the following research questions: (a) To what extent do new teachers associate the use of CPI in the classroom with broad principles of democratic education? and (b) To what extent do new teachers view the practicality of integrating CPI within the classroom? Findings suggest that participants associate CPI with citizenship education (e.g., voting) instead of reform-oriented components of democratic education (e.g., providing spaces for historically marginalized groups and overturning the status quo). Additionally, findings suggest that although novice educators remain enthusiastic about using CPI in their pedagogy, several constraints prevent them from feeling confident about discussing critical and current issues in their classrooms. On the basis of these findings, future research should explore ways in which teacher preparation programs can foster a deeper understanding of democratic education in teachers and ways in which CPI can be effectively integrated into the secondary classroom.

AB  - This article communicates the results of a Danish survey study conducted in 2018 that aimed to examine initiatives relating to computational thinking in primary and lower-secondary schools, as well as the professional development of teachers and the perceptions of school principals in this area. The context is an increasing interest in this field, motivated by a sense that it is important for children to learn computational thinking skills. However, educators struggle with questions regarding what computational thinking in education actually is--and consequently, how they should teach and assess it. In this survey, we wanted to explore existing practices and current situations to find out what school principals regard as important; thus, we designed an electronic questionnaire on this topic. 98 principals started the survey, and 83 completed it. Our analysis suggests that many initiatives connected to computational thinking are currently being implemented, but according to the principals taking part, teachers are not trained to teach this subject. The principals have inclusive views and focus on broad aspects of what computational thinking involves. According to them, computational thinking is not about pushing students into computing careers; rather it is about supporting the well-rounded development of human beings in a free and democratic society. However, the principals do report limited understanding of this subject, which suggests that teachers are not the only ones in need of training--principals also need help to develop a culture and mindset around this subject and implement it efficiently into schools.

AB  - This paper presents data from an Australian high school classroom, investigating how students and their teacher negotiate readings of literature in order to arrive at meanings that are valued by subject English, as well as understood by the students. Subject English acts a vital agent for the transmission of both literacy and literary knowledge in English-speaking countries, and students which do not share the cultural and social orientations valued by the subject and its texts have the potential to be disadvantaged. However, I argue that this clash of socio-cultural perspectives may be positively viewed as an advantage for democratic education, as it allows students' critical understanding of their world to be challenged, for teachers to include student perspectives, and for students to be empowered to participate in institutional discourses. Implications for teacher practice and educational theory are discussed.

AB  - A limited number of empirical studies have explored pupils' democratic practice and the direct experiences of school children using a qualitative approach. The aim of the present study has been to analyse pupils' experiences of the practice of democratic rights in the context of the Norwegian school. The study adopts a qualitative methodology, using semi-structured interviews with pupils. Three prominent school arenas were focused on: the mandatory pupil-teacher dialogue, the pupil council and classroom discussions. Three main markers of democracy have been used in the data analysis: contextual openness, participation and the ability to engage in democratic discussions. The findings reveal that all three markers of democracy, although variously distributed, were visible in these school arenas. The findings in the study are discussed in terms of implications for the development of pupils' future democratic competencies and the educational mandate schools have in preparing young people for adult participation in society.

AB  - The United States (US) has since its inception considered the education of its citizens as critical for preserving democracy. The recent attractiveness of autocratic leaders, not only in the US but across the world, raises questions about the dominant educational model now in place. We argue that the authoritarian and business-oriented structure and the information delivery model of learning today produce students who learn to rely on ready-made answers from those in authority. We describe, in contrast, the educational practices and philosophies of John Dewey and Socrates that expect students to find and evaluate their own answers. We also describe our experiences as professors in an American public university that for some time promoted through its policies and procedures equality between teacher and student and diversity among students through individualized learning activities. The result, we argue, were students comfortable with dialogic learning, collaborative inquiry, and independent thinking. We also describe how, despite its initial promise, our college, along other such schools, could not be sustained. We suggest that while the fragility of democratic education may be due to external factors over which we have no control, it is also due to certain human traits: a predisposition for efficiency and immediate decision-making, which makes it difficult to acknowledge ignorance or engage in self-examination; and the need for control, the lure of power and its corollary, the will to submit. If teachers would critically examine their reliance upon lectures, textbooks, and exams and consider other models of teaching, we believe they could, within their own classrooms, create communities of dialogue, collaboration, and free thought. We call upon both teachers and students to explore ways of learning that are inherently democratic and will help democracy, not autocracy, flourish in society and all its institutions.

AB  - This self-study examines my work as a teacher of "Moral Preparation for the Army," a program inspired by Freire and implemented in an Israeli public high school. Together with a fellow teacher educator serving as critical friend, I reflected on my practice through memory-work, and analyzed it in light of critical pedagogy. Looking back, I acknowledged Freire's inspiration: offering complex conceptions on sociopolitical issues and encouraging me to inquire into my ideological objectives and question the openness of my dialogue. The result is a novel interpretation of the critical pedagogue's role, providing insights for teacher educators on how to teach Freirean pedagogy and how to guide their student teachers to maintain an ethics of diversity and inclusion, particularly when facing anti-democratic threats.

AB  - Discourses and relations of child/adult and early education are super-permeated with ideas and practices of authority and boundary-making. In early years' practices, deeply important beliefs and assumptions about who or what has authority and who or what should create the boundaries of everyday activity often go unquestioned. This produces different kinds of epistemic injustice in respect of children and those who work with them, as well as through the materialities of early childhood and training settings, including higher education. These systems of authority both express and produce wider patterns of living associated with the wider society, including democracies. Posthumanism inspires questions about not only ways of knowing, but also about the privileging of dis/embodied knowing over feeling, intuiting, sensing, making, and moving. This paper thinks from the diffractive position that knowing is a direct material and moving engagement to explore possibilities for "sympoietic" pedagogies of enquiry-making-with (Haraway, 2016), and examines how these generate new ideas about early childhood practices and what professional knowledge might become. We illustrate this diffractive curriculum and pedagogy through an example from teacher education in South Africa to make important connections between authority, pedagogy, and an enlarged framework for democratic education; in this work, we explore "sympoietic" approaches to negotiation.

AB  - School is a miniature society where learners interact with each other during classroom practices. Teachers provide opportunities to students for active participation to make them responsible for socialization. They exercise democratic practices in classrooms to modify students' democratic thoughts to meet social demands of democracy. Present research aims to find out elementary schools' students' perceptions regarding teachers' classroom democratic practices. Quantitative research approach based on positivist paradigm was followed through conducting survey. Sample comprised 3600 respondents: 1260 male and 2340 female students from 6th, 7th and 8th grades randomly selected from 120 public sector elementary schools from three zones of Punjab Province: Northern, Central and Southern. Self-developed questionnaire consisted of 19 statements mode of 5-point Likert type options was used for data collection. Validity of self-developed questionnaire was confirmed through experts' opinion and reliability was assured by calculating Cronbach's Alpha score; 0.86. Data were analyzed using SPSS by calculating independent sample ttest and one way ANOVA. Findings showed significant difference that male teachers were practicing more democratic practices as compared to female teachers; urban schools' teachers were practicing more democratic practices as compared to rural schools' teachers and teachers teaching to 8th grade were practicing more democratic practices as compared to the teachers teaching to 7th and 6th grades students. Research recommends that teachers need to exercise democratic practices during teaching learning process in classrooms to make students participatory to meet the demands of democratic society.

AB  - Introduction: Globalization provided people in once isolated lands with an array of democracy types and international principles. The boosting traditional, conventional, societal, ethnical, and cultural differences in countries all over the world are pushing educational authorities to reexamine their contemporary habits, customs, principles, and practices of citizenship. Examining the assumptions and methods of cultural democracy in education settings is the foundation of critical pedagogy. Thus, a critical multicultural pedagogy is formed on critical views on democracy and diversity by illuminating the transformative nature of citizenship. Accordingly, this study inquires the conceptual grounds of class teachers in a phenomenological tradition in that it investigates the conceptions of these teachers on the concept of diversity and democracy. The data of the study were gathered through a questionnaire, besides semi-structured interview questions designed by the researcher. Based on a mix method research design, this study makes use of both qualitative and quantitative techniques to collect the required data. 160 class teachers officially working in diverse regions in Turkey voluntarily participated in the study (N=150 for the questionnaire and N=10 for the interview). Related implications to raise the awareness of class teachers on diversity and democracy were presented at the end of the study. Methods: This study searched for the conceptual underpinnings of the class teachers in the phenomenological tradition (Marton, 1981). Just like other methods to utilize philosophical phenomenology to the social sciences (Entwistle, 1997), the interpretative process of phenomenographic research is quite similar to that of grounded theory which refers to a set of systematic inductive methods to practice qualitative research (Richardson, 1999). Based on a mix method research design, this study makes use of both qualitative and quantitative techniques to collect data. Results: The findings demonstrate that class teachers are open to new perspectives, diverse religions and different genders. Thus, it can be said that a critical perspective was adopted by class teachers. Further, class teachers should be included into curriculum and syllabus design which are solely carried out by policy makers. Otherwise, critical skills of class teachers might be destroyed in the process of education. Thus, primary school curriculums and textbooks need to focus on the importance of democracy and diversity. Policy makers, Ministry of National Education, Turkey and Higher Council of Education need to include critical theory and critical pedagogy into curriculum. Future studies should focus on the views of both novice and professional class teachers. In addition, views regarding democracy and diversity from different cultures need to be examined in future research. Direct democracy, representative democracy, gender diversity, cultural diversity and pluralistic perspectives need to be adopted by related textbook publishers, classroom teaching departments, administrators and policy makers. Discussion: The findings of the study show that the participants developed a positive perspective towards democracy and diversity, although some issues in the context of Turkey are hardly mentioned or criticized (Dodd, 1992). The most important problem in examining democracy and diversity was religion because the participants stated that they respect religion, in their case Islam, because they somewhat would not want to hear church bell in a land of Islam (Bader, 2007). Diversity has been conceptualized as a positive element in the study. Since democracy and diversity are interrelated and interwoven, the participants generally adopted these terms (Banks et al., 2005). Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that the respondents had positive conceptions on individual and cultural diversities. Further, they developed good attitudes towards cultural democracy and they believe in the power of integration through individual differences. Critical pedagogy is an educational theory which aims to form a progressive and democratic culture by means of critical inquiry, which consequently results in valuing and respecting personal and cultural differences. Critical pedagogy perceives teaching as a naturally political event, refuses the neutrality of knowledge, and asserts that matters of social justice and democracy are not recognizable from only educational activities.

AB  - Principals in Kenyan schools are required to adopt democratic school leadership practises as part of the government policy. Adopting an interpretive case study, this paper set out to explore the application of democracy, ethics and social justice in secondary schools in Kenya. The study was in two phases. Phase one: twelve school principals were interviewed to explore their perspectives on democratic school leadership and establish the rationale for selecting two case schools. Phase two: an in-depth case study was conducted in the two schools. Interviews, focus group discussions, observation and informal conversations were used to generate data. The findings suggest that the principals, teachers and students each perceive and apply democratic school leadership differently based on individual as well as the school socio-cultural context. These contrasting views provide grounds for further discourse on the phenomenon. The paper recommends formal training for principals through in-service courses. Inclusion of democratic school leadership principles in teacher training programmes and an inculcation of democratic school leadership practices/values in the school curriculum for students to create a shared vision and understanding of these concepts for the success of the school.

AB  - In this essay, a broad spectrum of the work of influential educational scholars was examined in order to identify crucial components of teaching for democracy. Synthesizing the literature with their experiences as middle level teachers and teacher educators, the authors determined those conceptions that would be most fruitful for moving pre-service teachers to enact the more "muscular" concepts that foster civic participation and social justice. This collaboration resulted in the identification of four democratic practices as a foundation for designing a course on teaching for democracy. These included amplification of the voices of historically marginalized people, recognition that those in power must work to meet the needs of those without power, recognition of the advantages of diversity even at the potential expense of efficiency, and collaboration in order to teach for democracy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine democratic and distributed leadership perceptions of teachers in their school and to explore the relationship between democratic and distributed leadership. This study intended to enrich and expand scholarly reflections on democratic and distributed leadership as regards considering the association between them, thereby deepening our understanding of leadership. Correlational research design was used as a research design in the study. Study population included teachers working at high schools in Eskisehir district in Turkey. Stratified sampling was used as a sampling method. The study sample included 462 teachers working at high schools. Descriptive statistics for democratic leadership suggested that respondent teachers perceive democratic leadership in their school in moderate level. Support and supervision were perceived as distributed leadership functions of the leadership team in schools. Regarding the leadership team characteristics, it was concluded that leadership teams are moderately perceived as coherent. The study results also revealed that there is a strong relationship between democratic leadership, distribution of leadership functions and coherent leadership team characteristics.

AB  - There is little doubt of public school's role in the enculturation of youth into American democracy. There are several aspects about which little is known that should be addressed prior to seeking options to understand and address civic education for the 21st century: first, the desired civic knowledge, skills, and predispositions are not clearly identified; and second, little is known about the knowledge, skills, and beliefs of the faculty, administration, staff and board of education members about democracy or the patterns of congruence among adults connected to K-12 education. In this pilot study, we investigate the patterns of beliefs through the use of an innovative Q-sort and interviews of participants among four public school districts, a statewide group of policy advisors, and some teacher union officials.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine inservice high school band directors' perceptions and applications of democratic rehearsal procedures in concert band rehearsals. Respondents (N = 216) were members of the National Association for Music Education who were currently teaching concert band at the high school level. Respondents indicated that "identify and describe opportunities for individual and ensemble performance improvement" and "student-led sectionals" were considered the most important democratic rehearsal procedures for their students to experience. These same procedures were also the most frequently used democratic rehearsal procedures. Analysis of open-ended responses revealed that respondents believed student ownership, student engagement, and student growth as musicians and leaders were advantages to implementing democratic rehearsal procedures. Potential disadvantages included issues related to student ability, rehearsal time limitations, unfamiliar classroom dynamics, and availability of classroom resources. Implications for music teachers are discussed.

AB  - Background: There is scant research on whether or how special education teacher preparation plays a role in shaping, maintaining, or perpetuating ableism and oppression for disabled students, which the author proposes is "structural ableism." This conceptual article argues that special education teacher preparation programs' systems and structures should be examined for ways they inadvertently contribute to ableist perceptions of disability to ensure that such structures do not influence the lenses and practice of the teachers they produce. Purpose: This article proposes that special education teacher preparation programs' systems and structures should be examined for ways they inadvertently contribute to oppressive educational conditions and negative or ableist perceptions of disability to ensure that such structures do not influence the lenses and practice of the teachers they produce. In this article, the author theorizes "structural ableism," which she defines as "a complex system of hierarchical and discriminatory processes, policies, and institutions that privilege and prefer able-bodied people, fail to represent or meaningfully include disabled persons' voices, and are grounded in a network of ableist beliefs and practices that maintain and reproduce unequal outcomes for disabled people and benefit able-bodied people." Conclusion: The author concludes that teacher preparation has a duty to embrace inclusivity through the lens of democratic education to help "shift disability toward a more inclusive ideology, and identify and dismantle oppressive structures that perpetuate ableism in teacher candidates."

AB  - The study aimed to determine how lecturers have adopted organizational democracy and academic freedom in Turkish state universities, as well as to find out their views on its appropriation for Turkey. A correlative descriptive survey model is used in this study. The study sample was included 418 academics working at state universities in Ankara. For this research, an "Organizational Democracy Scale? and an "Academic Freedom Scale? were developed and employed by the researcher, and the obtained data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The arithmetic mean and the standard deviation were calculated for the answers provided by the academics. Regression analysis was conducted to find out the effect of organizational democracy on academic freedom. In the qualitative phase of the study, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 20 academics. NVivo 10 software was used to analyze the content of the interviews. At the end of the study, it was found that university administrations should avoid discriminative attitudes; should account for their decisions and implementations; deans and faculty boards should be elected democratically; all stakeholders (apart from academics), including students, should take part in both elections and be involved in management processes; and finally, the election system should be more democratic.

AB  - Fiji's formal education system continues to be Eurocentric, and cultural democracy is a frequent source of contention in schools. This research investigated how culturally inclusive and sustainable learning environments can be fostered through culturally democratic classrooms, culturally relevant content and culturally responsive pedagogies. Data was collected through questionnaires and talanoa, and subjected to quantitative and narrative analysis. The study showed that culturally democratic classrooms, culturally relevant and responsive pedagogies, and skills for enhancing the usefulness of cultural knowledge are significantly lacking in Fiji classrooms. It also showed that democratic and culturally relevant, inclusive, and responsive classrooms necessitate a shift from the traditional colonial learning environment toward one that values cultural diversity, acknowledges multiple perceptions and diverse paradigms, and values critical thinking as well as social and cultural responsibility. The study recommends that the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts review the Fiji primary school curriculum and make it more culturally inclusive for teachers and students. The study also suggests that teacher education institutions should include cultural democracy, culturally relevant and responsive teaching, culturally inclusive pedagogies and resources, and training for lecturers on how to use them in their courses. They should also add more vernacular courses to their programs.

AB  - Belief in the fundamental importance of civic education for democracy has been long-standing. But if educators can agree that schools have an essential role to play in preparing students for informed engagement in civic and political life, they cannot seem to agree on what that means. The very same efforts that are applauded by some are viewed as misguided by others. The result for schoolchildren has been a mostly watered-down notion of civics that emphasizes good character and patriotism over critical thinking and engaging with multiple perspectives. At the same time, the number of young people worldwide now willing to entertain nondemocratic forms of government is on the rise. For example, nearly a quarter of U.S. youth aged 16 to 24 believe that democracy is a "bad" or "very bad" way of governing. About 70% of millennials do not think it is essential to live in a country governed by democratic rule of law. This article examines the ideological tensions that underlie civic education policies and practice in a time of rising populist support for anti-democratic forms of governance.

AB  - Students classified with disabilities make up more than 13 percent of the public school population in the United States, but they remain on the margins of social studies research. Thus, we know very little about social studies education in inclusive settings. This study explores how social studies methods classes in one teacher education program prepare teachers for inclusive education. Combining theoretical perspectives from democratic citizenship education and Disability Studies in Education (DSE), this study explores how themes of democracy, community, diversity, disability, and inclusion manifested in two social studies methods classes. Findings indicate the methods instructor encouraged and practiced democratic and inclusive pedagogy, but his approach often met resistance from preservice teachers' experiences with disability and inclusion, the intransigence of a traditional special education paradigm, and the limitations of diversity education vis-à-vis DSE. Implications for democratic citizenship education, inclusive education, and teacher education are discussed.

AB  - There is no how-to recipe for implementing pedagogical approaches, as each school, learner and teacher has a unique perception of the nature of critical mathematics education. It is therefore the duty of educators and school administrators to cultivate critical teaching and learning experiences that can connect the standardised school curriculum to the reality of learners' everyday lives. As such, this study investigated the pedagogical approaches which mathematics teacher educators employed in the development of democratic citizens in South African universities. Underpinned by the constructivist paradigm, the study employed a qualitative research approach and a case study design. Data were generated from a total of six mathematics teacher educators and 75 second- to fourth-year student teachers majoring in mathematics education across three different universities. The findings from the study revealed that there are contradictions between pedagogical philosophies and the mathematics teacher educators' ideal image of their practice in the classroom. The nature of mathematics teaching, and the fear that learners come to class with different knowledges from their personal experience and have disparate opinions, hinder critical and social engagement within mathematics education classrooms. Based on the findings, it is recommended that mathematics teacher educators employ a problem-posing pedagogical approach which allows for the appropriation of knowledge in the form of self-reflection, a synergy of care, and self-determination which seeks to foster democratic values and critical consciousness in the development of democratic citizens.

AB  - Democracy, a lifestyle as much as it is a form of government, begins to be learned in the family. The youth observe and acquire the democratic attitudes of their parents. The task of passing it on to the new generations and helping them acquire democratic values is the mission of schools, namely teachers. It is a commonly known fact that developmental level of countries shows parallelism with the democratic attitudes of individuals. It is important to understand the democratic perceptions and attitudes of teachers who are responsible for positioning democratic structure and thus raising the democratic level of countries. For this reason, the research aims to examine the democratic perceptions and attitudes of music teacher candidates in terms of some variables. Data collected using the democratic attitude scale was analyzed using t-test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results showed that attitude scores did not change according to gender, level of parents' education or the year students were in. Scale scores were negatively correlated with the amount of parents' income. There was no correlation between the students' GPAs and the scale scores. Music teaching requires a democratic environment intrinsically; therefore, the democratic perceptions and attitudes of the music teacher candidates who will carry out the music lessons in which they should maintain the democratic environment must be determined. As aforementioned notions suggest, this study is of the essence since the results will shed light on the academic staff in the institutions that train music teachers.

AB  - Global education is a cross curricular discipline, originating in the 1970s and 1980s, developed for schools by international educators in the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. One definition describes it as "education which promotes the knowledge, attitudes and skills relevant to living responsibly in a multicultural, interdependent world" (Fisher & Hicks, 1985, p. 8). Another definition states that "global education consists of efforts to bring about changes in the content, methods and social context of education in order to better prepare students for citizenship in a global age" (Kniep, 1985, p. 15). This article introduces the field of global education, describes its aims and objectives, and outlines the rationale for taking a global education approach to language teaching. It will describe and discuss a variety of initiatives undertaken by global language educators in classrooms, programs and schools around the world that promote democratic citizenship, foster social responsibility and engage students in working to solve local and global issues. It will conclude by encouraging language teachers to explore global education as a valuable cross-curricular approach to language teaching for democracy.

AB  - This study examines the underpinning core values which educators ought to have, and students must acquire at schools adequately according to preservice teachers' perception. The research was designed according to the quantitative model, and three open-ended questions questionnaire was used for data collection. The research group involved 263 preservice teachers. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings, first, revealed 17 values that teachers ought to have, 21 values that school principals ought to have, and 20 values that students ought to acquire. The revealed values were also categorized as follows: moral values, professional values, and cultural values. Examining the ideas of preservice teachers has importance because they carry the existing values and in return affect the value formation of the society in the future.

AB  - Freedom of expression is the core political ideal undergirding American democracy and recent attacks on freedom of speech are a direct threat to the liberties and rights guaranteed in the United States Constitution. Freedom of expression is essential for participatory democracy, scientific progress, individualism, and civic education in K-12 schools and universities. Citizens must have access to all opinions, empirical evidence, historical information, and competing narratives to make informed decisions regarding political candidates, policies, and issues. This necessitates the right to express offensive, controversial, repugnant, and radical opinions and values that that are shocking to government or specific groups. Indeed, this is the primary purpose of the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech and the press. However, this freedom is experiencing a withering assault from special interest groups, Big Tech social media entities, and most ironically, universities, ostensibly the ultimate guardians of freedom of expression. "Hate" speech codes and other attempts at censorship are anathema to democracy. Attacks on freedom of expression are an existential threat to social studies education. Thus, it is incumbent upon all social studies professors and K-12 social studies educators to combat this dangerous attack on the First Amendment.

AB  - In this study, the effects of student club activities in high schools in Kars province, Turkey on the development of students' social skills, democracy and governance skills, recreation education and community service skills were examined. The qualitative research technique was used in the study and data were collected with the semi-structured interview technique. The data were obtained from 8 school principals and 12 club advisors from different school types determined with the maximum variation sampling method. According to the results, the educators in the sample concluded that the student clubs achieved their objectives in the theme of democracy and governance skills but were not effective in the other themes. The reasons for this ineffectiveness emerged as deficiencies in the physical environment in the schools, lack of time allotted for activities, excessive numbers of students in the clubs and unwillingness of teachers with regard to club activities. It was suggested that if the choice of whether or not to engage in club activities is left to students, the activities in clubs will become more attractive and thus their effectiveness will increase.

AB  - This article sets out to explore how young people understand and experience the notions of democracy and participation in their secondary schools. We draw on their own words to examine their perspective on "participation" in everyday life at school to understand what kind of democratic education they are participating in. The article forms part of the "Demoskole" project, which studies democracy and the participation of school community members in secondary schools in Catalunya (Spain). To date, our fieldwork suggests that while, in most cases, the opportunity for pupils to participate in decision-making processes is limited, there are differences between schools. Two factors, in particular, appear to have a significant impact in terms of improving pupil participation. The existence of relationships based on trust and more horizontal forms of collaboration between teachers and pupils leads to a sense of wellbeing. This, in turn, has an effect on the atmosphere within the school. The article focuses on the characteristics that distinguish the three schools that took part in the study with the aim of analysing those elements that lead to the creation of a more or less democratic atmosphere in the relations between the various members of the school community.

AB  - In this narrative inquiry, the author dramatises the tensions and discoveries that emerged in a literature course for pre-service and in-service teachers in an English education graduate programme. The students' resistance to the instructor's choice of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" as a central text led to reflection on responsible and responsive approaches for managing the inclusion or excision of canonical texts by white authors in the syllabi of literature courses designed for secondary English teachers as well as within the secondary English curriculum. The author also explores the tension between a belief in an open, democratic learning environment and the authority structures that reinforce the power of the teacher or teacher educator.

AB  - This paper examines contemporary challenges for education and democracy in Brazil. In the past decade, conservative forces headed by the Escola sem Partido (ESP) movement have led a scaremongering campaign against teachers and public education, with Paulo Freire's critical educational philosophies as their main enemy. This study investigates the ESP's attempts to implement its 'neutral' education model based in traditional values across the country. Key Freirean concepts combined with Horsford '3Rs' agenda to regain democracy in schools are used to analyse the media narratives presented by the ESP and civil movements that have resisted its efforts to undermine democracy within Brazilian schools. The findings suggest that the ESP's bullying tactics have been effective in undermining teachers' autonomy in many Brazilian schools. Further tensions have been provoked by the pandemic within the public educational system. Conversely, Freirean-inspired school communities have found new ways to counteract this harassment and strengthen democratic pedagogies.

AB  - Introduction: The quality of school depends on a well-functioning school management, managed by the top school managers. It is very important to know the real conditions of the school to be able to provide any effective changes. Especially, it is necessary to know the educational process which can be efficiently determined by an inspection process. The inspection process is present in current pedagogical science and in pedagogical practice which deserves increased attention of all participants in the educational process. Methods: The study is based on a theoretical analysis of the presented issues and on a research. The findings were analysed, compared, and conclusions were drawn for school practice. We used the following research methods: (1) content analysis of the existing literature; (2) the quantitative method of gathering data by the medium of a twelve-item questionnaire containing four closed and eight semi-open questions. The questionnaire contained data necessary to process and evaluate the questionnaire, these were inserted as the last question; (3) statistical data processing methods. Results: New times bring a new style of management and a new understanding of the inspecting activity, which creates a partnership between the student and the teacher. It is to promote mutual understanding between them, based on the principles of democracy. Innovations in the educational practice also affect the realization of inspecting activities. The aim of managers, as well as inspectors, is to promote inspections not only as a tool for evaluating the teaching process but also as methodological help for teachers. The goal of our research was to map the state of the inspecting activity in selected high schools and to find out about the changes in teachers' opinions on inspecting activities over the twenty-year horizon. We cannot generalize our findings for schools of all kinds as only 88 respondents (44 respondents participated in the 1998 research and 44 respondents in the 2017 research) took part in our research. Discussion: Managing the educational process and taking the responsibility for its quality are among the basic duties of the school management and in the conditions of the Slovak Republic, as it follows from Act no. 596/2003 on state administration in education and school self-government as last amended. Supervising school leadership is one of the fundamental means of feedback that allows the study of the level of educational and training results, the fulfillment of the conceptual development of school, and the fulfillment of the tasks in the short-term school plan. The objective of the principal of the school is to obtain objective information about the level and the outcomes of the educational work of the school and, if deficiencies are identified, it is his/her duty to eliminate them. The most important task of the school is to implement the School Educational Program in line with the State Educational Program (SEP), which should take into account the needs of students, the interests of students and their parents, and contribute to improving the processes going on in the school, especially in the educational process. The research revealed that inspections conducted by school managers (the principal, deputies, administrators) are the most beneficial for the work of teachers. This fact was caused by the effort of the school managers to view inspections as a means of personal growth of teachers and not only as a controlling mechanism of teachers' work. This was also confirmed by the research showing that inspections by the members of school management are now clearly focused on emphasizing the positive aspect of teachers' work. This was caused by a shift in the inspectors' perception of the inspecting activities in the period of twenty years - they use them as a teacher-oriented tool. Limitations: The number of participants in the research sample was one of the methodological limitations of this research. We cannot consider this number to be representative for the purpose of generalizing the results. Conclusion: In this study, we realized a mutual comparison of attitudes and opinions of teachers regarding inspecting activities. This comparative study, taking into account the twenty-year time span, has shown that the inspectors (school managers) have acquired such methods of evaluating their teachers, which objectively refer of their actual performance, that the most beneficial inspections for teachers' own pedagogical work are the inspections conducted by the members of the school management, that the adherence to pedagogical ethics by the inspectors has an increasing tendency, and that formalism, as well as the subjective evaluation of teacher's work, have a downward tendency and have disappeared from the conclusions of inspections. Based on the research results, it can be concluded that, in the course of two decades, significant changes have taken place in the realization of inspections, both on the part of the inspectors and on the part of the teachers and their perception of inspections.

AB  - An important factor that may be missing from recent attempts to counter, resist, and/or reconceptualize the neoliberal framing of the early education process is the actions of children, particularly those that reinforce the neoliberal assemblage of schooling they learn through their interactions with their teacher in school. This article begins to address this issue by employing Foucault's conceptions of governmentality to examine how a teacher and students in a kindergarten classroom located in the USA give voice to and make choices that reflect the dominant neoliberal discourses of schooling. Such an analysis creates the opportunity to consider what needs to be done to assist both early educators and the children themselves so that they can live in the presence of each other within their neoliberal classrooms otherwise.

AB  - This article engages postcolonial debate on citizenship education's power-knowledge nexus by interrogating the concerns of 37 secondary schoolteachers in a Western Cape Xhosa township, the first created during the apartheid era. Unmasking power-knowledge divides in the localisation of global norms, the data reveal state dismissal of indigenous knowledge in curriculum, problems associated with the status accorded English in a multilingual society, and the need for a culturally relevant African curriculum. Examined through 'politics of expression' (recognition, positioning, and equality), the analysis considers alternative theories of power that the African ethic of Ubuntu (humanness) might offer to guide democratic citizenship education.

AB  - Prompted by the centenary of the founding of Summerhill, in my contribution to this JOPE Suite on Democratic Education, I briefly explore both the admiring reciprocity and the subsidiary but significant differences of praxis between A.S. Neill and Alex Bloom, two remarkable pioneers of education in and for participatory democracy as a way of life. Because A.S. Neill's work is internationally renowned and Alex Bloom's has yet to re-establish the worldwide recognition it had in his own lifetime, my emphasis is on the contribution of Alex Bloom, in large part because he is amongst the most radical pioneers of democratic education the UK state sector has ever known. To a significant degree, the aspirations and actualities of Bloom's work rebutted Neill's insistence that pioneers within the state sector of education could not innovate in ways that would significantly challenge the status quo. Indeed, Alex Bloom extended participatory democratic educational aspirations in ways which Neill did not. Most importantly, these not only entailed a commitment to community engagement, they did so in conditions of abject poverty and profound psychological trauma following the ravages of the Second World War London Blitz with its attendant evacuation and subsequent return to the ruins of their former homes. In the first section, I take as my starting point Alex Bloom's strongly supportive review of A.S. Neill's book "The Problem Family" and Neill's visit to Bloom's school in the East End of London, some five years later. Foregrounding the dialectic of practice and aspiration, I touch on some of the key issues that emerged for both Neill and Bloom at that time. Challenging Neill's later affirmation that the only significant freedom one can introduce into a state school is 'a free attitude on the teacher's part, his or her being on the side of the child' and his reported view that Bloom and others might be able to experiment in methods of teaching or ways of organising the timetable, 'but not in methods of living', the second section explores the nature and interrelationship of six key strands woven into the fabric of Alex Bloom's truly remarkable work that exemplified the grounded possibility and vibrant actuality of participatory democracy as a way of living and learning together that prefigures a more just, creative and caring form of human engagement. Locating the foundation of Alex Bloom's praxis within the 20th-century personalist philosophical tradition and its Adlerian psychological counterpart, the brief concluding section draws in particular on the work of John Macmurray who argues, as did Bloom in his own writing and his daily praxis, that 'The first priority in education--if by education we mean learning to be human--is learning to live in personal relation to other people. Let us call it learning to live in community'.

AB  - Purpose: Few studies have examined student teachers' perceptions of teaching materials on democracy. For the purpose of addressing how teacher education in social science might contribute to student teachers' qualifications for teaching democracy, this study investigated student teachers' perceptions of the 'Democracy Cake' as a set of teaching materials for teaching democracy in social science education. Design/methodology/approach: This study relied on a survey and observations among 47 student teachers in a social science didactics course. Findings: Analyses of student teachers' perceptions revealed concerns about teaching social science concepts, engagement of secondary school students in classroom discussions and the theoretical framing of the teaching materials. Research limitations: The study focused on 47 student teachers' perceptions of a particular set of teaching materials and may not be generalisable. Practical implications: This study indicates that social science teacher education might benefit from involving student teachers in the examination of teaching materials.

AB  - Peer education regarding respect for LGB individuals can be understood as citizenship education with a specific content. Students who participate in an intervention to increase respect for sexual and gender minorities may also increase their general citizenship competences. Also, participation in such an intervention may strengthen students' awareness of the relationship between reflections on citizenship and attitudes toward LGB people. A peer educator intervention on sexual and gender minorities was implemented in pre-vocational secondary education by peer educators and 13 to 17 years old students. We examined the impact on attitudes toward LGB peers with a one-group pretest post-test design, and also used this method to examine reflections on acting as a democratic citizen. We found one significant (positive) correlation between a positive judgment of LGB peers and reflection on acting in a socially responsible manner, which was one of the three democratic citizenship reflection scales we used. No effects were found on either attitudes toward LGB peers or reflection on acting as a democratic citizen. Peer education that is more integrated into the daily social practice of students may increase impact.

AB  - The theory of deliberative democracy places public deliberations at the heart of democracy. In order to participate in democratic deliberations, citizens need certain skills, attitudes, and values. Within the field of education for deliberative democracy, it is assumed that these are learned through participation in democratic deliberation. Thus, one way to educate future citizens for deliberative democracy is by constructing democratic deliberations in the classroom. In this article, four strategically chosen examples of discussions taking place inside classrooms are analyzed, in order to flesh out the abstract criteria of democratic deliberations and to create an empirically based typology of classroom discussions. In this article I also aspire to contribute to classroom practices by pointing out how teachers can steer classroom discussions toward democratic deliberation: They can use questions that open up space for disagreement, while at the same time present opportunities to reach collective conclusions.

AB  - In this article we explore the perspectives of school leadership and management on the principal's role in learners' academic performance. School leadership and learner performance continue to be of great concern in the South African education system. We explore the relationship between school leadership and learner performance from a school leadership and management perspective. Since the attainment of democracy, the South African education landscape has been plagued by poor learner performance. While the reasons are as diverse as the nation itself, the adverse effects of poor learner performance on the school system or the quality of education cannot be overemphasised. As a result, we explored school leadership and learner performance as it relates to the leadership of secondary school principals. Principals' lived stories provided the empirical evidence for this article. The findings reveal that a principal's leadership plays an important role in school management and learner performance.

AB  - Investigating socioeconomic status (SES) biases, Nepalese children and adolescents (N = 605, 52% girls, M[subscript age] = 13.21, SD[subscript age] = 1.74) attending schools that varied by SES composition were asked to anticipate whether a peer would include a high or low SES character as a math partner. Novel findings were that students attending mixed SES schools were more likely to expect inclusion of a low SES character than were students attending high SES schools. With age, high SES participants attending mixed SES schools increasingly expected the inclusion of the low SES character. Moreover, teachers' democratic beliefs in high SES schools predicted inclusive expectations. Teacher beliefs and school diversity play a significant role for fostering students' inclusivity in educational contexts.

AB  - The objective of this study [Susinos, T. (Dir.), 'Schools moving towards inclusion: Learning from the local community, the student voice and educational support' (I+D+I, EDU2011-29928-C03-03)] is to gain a deeper understanding of the analysis of the discourses that different education professionals in the Spanish education system have on student participation in schools, based on the premise that they tacitly reflect different models of democracy and advance very diverse school practices. The study is based on the Student Voice Movement, which is defined by its commitment to deliberative democratic education and its role in the development of inclusive schools. In this article, we have conducted a qualitative analysis of the data from 31 in-depth interviews carried out with teachers and other education professionals from nine schools. These teachers' discourses are summarised in four dimensions, which we have named individual, pedagogical, organisational and socio-political. Some conclusions of this work demonstrate a predominance of discourses linked to an individual and pedagogical dimension of participation, based on the idea that this fundamentally depends on the personal dispositions that some students have. It is less common to appeal to the socio-political dimension, which refers to participation as a citizen's right to debate and make decisions regarding common and public affairs. This suggests that teachers still see their work from a technical point of view, rather than envisaging the school as a space for democratic participation and practice. In short, with this study we aim to contribute to normative theories on participation and democracy in order to expand their empirical and practical support in schools.

AB  - In this paper, we draw on policy sociology and democratic theory to illustrate how evidence-based practice not only limits teachers' capacities to exercise professional discretion and authority, but also jeopardises the democratic project of schooling more broadly. Using theoretical concepts from Foucault's discipline with Connolly's pluralisation, we argue that evidence-based practice disciplines teachers to comply with a prescribed set of criteria, which constrains their capacity to respond to the evolving and emergent needs of their students and communities. Our argument is built from two projects conducted separately, but concurrently, in Australia and Denmark. The projects involved in-depth interviews with teachers, extensive observations within schools, and the collection and analysis of policy documents and artefacts. Using illustrative excerpts from both studies, we show how teacher participants expressed and embodied inclinations to do (or be) differently, but nonetheless felt the need to adhere to what the evidence established as the right way to do or be. In our view, this points to an increasingly rigid ontological space through which teachers can do, be and become, which raises questions about the extent to which an 'ethos of pluralisation' is possible within these schools.

AB  - This article explores how social class, "race," and their intersections manifest in Finnish popular music education (PME) through an exploration of popular music practices in one upper elementary music classroom where I worked as a teacher-researcher. By engaging with systems reflexivity, I illustrate how social class, racialization, and their intersections work together with the social system of PME to maintain inequalities. I argue that in the popular music classroom, identity work is especially required from the students who belong to racialized and lower-class groups. Furthermore, I argue that PME (re)produces a Eurocentric practice of "school popular music" that favors middle-classness and Whiteness. I suggest that moving towards genuinely multivocal and democratic music education entails questioning popular music as an eminent democracy maker. Alternatively, democracy might be fostered by considering the intersectional identities of the students--a process for which systems reflexivity serves as a useful tool.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify teacher opinions about democracy education at primary schools in Turkey. The research is designed as a single case study. The study group was selected with an purposive cum convenience sampling method and consists of 15 teachers working at a primary school in Ankara, Turkey. The data were gathered with a semi-structured interview form that is developed by researchers. The data were coded by different coders and analyzed with the descriptive analysis method. Findings show that teachers don't get any formation on teaching democracy both during their university years and through in-service training during their professional life. The teachers also share the opinion that the activities in the curricula and books are not enough. Democracy education should be given with concrete activities that are also suitable for the students' level. The teachers state that they do democracy education activities in their lessons. It is concluded from the research that democracy education activities should have more place in the curricula and thereupon course books, teacher candidates and the teachers should get more and applied courses and training, also teachers should give more place to structured and expedient democracy education activities in their lessons.

AB  - In this case study, we aim to understand the leadership practices in a two-site rural school (schools in rural areas located on two or more sites) in the province of Valencia (Spain), by examining the perceptions and aspirations of the educational community. Results reveal two points of view in perceptions of leadership in the school: on one hand community members hold a classic, traditional view of leadership; on the other hand, they recognize that leadership is opening up to all the groups in the educational community, which inspires positive attitudes to taking part in leadership processes. The types of leaders identified in the school, educational community participation in decision making, and teamwork are some of the aspects that advance the development of a more distributed form of leadership. However, resistance to change by some families has hindered the community's aspirations to distributed leadership. There is therefore a need to revisit the way this concept and its characteristics are constructed, and to pool ideas to decide what direction the community wants to take in the future. Additionally, one way to advance the school's democratic, distributed leadership model is to continue working on the relationships between sections of the educational community through cooperative organization in the school.

AB  - This article is concerned with presenting a qualitative study of teachers dealing with undemocratic attitudes in secondary school. The research question was: how do teachers teach when the aim is to remove undemocratic attitudes and prevent the formation of undemocratic attitudes? The research group which was part of the study established collaboration with two teacher groups at a Norwegian secondary school. This collaboration included two start-up meetings, filming and observation of teaching sessions, as well as group interviews with two different teacher groups about the teaching which had been filmed and observed. The findings were analysed by way of the theory of indirect pedagogy and its different models for teaching, including both direct and indirect approaches of teaching. First, there is the model of direct instruction; second, there is the model of indirect summoning which is specified; and third, there is the model of indirect summoning which is unspecified. A major finding was that the teachers who participated in the study combined direct and indirect approaches in their teaching. While direct approaches and the model of indirect summoning which is specific were mostly used for learning purposes, such as acquiring knowledge of certain concepts (epistemology), the model of indirect summoning which is unspecified was particularly prominent in situations where the purpose was to make students responsible for society and democracy (existence and morality).

AB  - This article considers how the development of for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) technologies fosters the privatization of public education and erodes the values and practices of democratic education. The introduction situates the advent of digital technologies in the context of the structural economic and ideological shifts of the past 40 years. Such changes include neo-liberal restructuring, the repressive school and social turn, changes in the use of positivist ideology in schooling, the role of new technologies in social and cultural reproduction and changing imperatives for capital accumulation. The article illustrates different uses of AI as part of the technological turn of public education privatization. Examples include: (1) adaptive learning technology, and transformations to teacher work and conceptions of knowledge and learning; (2) biometric pedagogy and the cultural politics of locating learning in the body; and (3) the convergence of impact investing and digital surveillance technologies. The article considers how changes in the ownership and control over different aspects of public education relate to the cultural politics of knowledge and learning. It also examines how, under the guise of disinterested objectivity and neutrality, particular class and cultural ideologies and interests are promoted through new technologies, with significant pedagogical, cultural, economic and political implications. The article concludes by arguing that AI education is a site of cultural and political contestation and must be comprehended as a form of representational politics. By showing a critical pedagogical AI project, the article suggests that the anti-democratic tendencies of most AI education is hardly inevitable or determined, but rather represents a replication of long-standing ideologies.

AB  - Children's citizenship in early childhood education and care is the root of democracy, equity, and sustainability. In Aotearoa New Zealand, "Te Whariki" has a strong aspiration for children as competent and active citizens. Early childhood settings are sites where children may have opportunities to act as powerful citizens. Employing Foucault's theory of discourse and power, this article analyses interviews from 12 kindergarten teachers in Aotearoa. This article reveals multiple discourses underpinning power dynamics regarding children's citizenship in selected Aotearoa kindergartens and offers insight into children's citizenship as a power-sharing pedagogy

AB  - This study examined the relationship between preschool teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and their teaching attitudes. In the study, it was considered whether preschool teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and their teaching attitudes change in terms of certain variables. The research was carried out using a correlational survey model. The target population of the study is the preschool teachers working in Küçükçekmece district, Istanbul Province, in the 2017-2018 academic year. The working group consists of 264 preschool teachers working at the schools in said district. The following assessment instruments were used in the research: "Personal Information Form," "Preschool Teachers' Self-efficacy Beliefs Scale," to identify preschool teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and 'Preschool Teachers' Teaching Attitudes Scale' to determine the teachers' attitudes. The obtained data were analyzed using Pearson multiplication moment correlation analysis, and Regression analysis was performed to determine the level of self-efficacy beliefs of preschool teachers affecting teaching attitudes. Preschool teachers were found to have full self-efficacy beliefs in the teaching-learning process, communication skills, planning, and regulation of learning environments and classroom management, and firm self-efficacy beliefs in family participation. Teachers' attitudes of preschool teachers were found to be democratic at the highest level, followed by autocratic and laissez-faire at the lowest level. As a result of the regression analysis made to determine the level of the effect of self-efficacy beliefs of preschool teachers on their teaching attitudes, the learning and teaching process positively predicts democratic teaching attitudes and negatively predicts laissez-faire attitudes.

AB  - This article analyzes how guns emerged as both urgent topics of dialogue and common features of everyday life for 228 students and their teachers in six communities across the United States who participated in the Digital Democratic Dialogue (3D) Project, a year long social design-based experiment aimed at foregrounding youth voice and fostering connection across lines of geographic and ideological difference. We trace the myriad ways that guns literally and discursively shaped the multiple ecological contexts of the 3D Project in order to detail youth sociopolitical learning and extend traditional models of civic education. We propose a paradigm of speculative civic literacies that privileges a collaborative push toward democratic interrogation and innovation over integration into existing civic and political structures.

AB  - Over the past decade, Japan's rich tradition of environmental education-related policy has shifted to encompass international discourse concerning global competition and education for sustainable development. In view of this shift, this article explores environmental education-related policy enactment from the perspective of high school teachers. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 experienced teachers and were analysed using the environmental education-related conceptual lenses of Lucas (1972) and Stevenson (1987, 2007). The findings suggest that the current policy enactment in Japanese high schools features a narrow interpretation of environmental education that emphasises knowledge acquisition and overlooks the development of practical skills, attitudes or democratic citizenship. This case study highlights the necessity that, for a progressive environmental education to become established, policymakers must find a way to balance local knowledge with the demands of international organizations, paying particular attention to curriculum ideology, policy competition and the teachers' voice in policy creation.

AB  - School leadership plays a significant role in the success of a school through its effects on teachers' efficacy.Empirical studies of school leadership in South Asia are limited. This study seeks to address this gap. The author examines teachers' perceptions about how school principals play their role in high-achieving and low-achieving community high schools in Nepal through the lenses of a multidimensional model. Based on interviews with 18 teachers teaching in multiple disciplines, it was found that teachers in the high-achieving schools perceived their principals' behavior positively compared to their counterparts from low-achieving schools. Dedicated, devoted principals with positive and collaborative leadership styles have greater influence on most teachers.

AB  - This paper seeks to recommend a democratic model to curriculum development in Algeria that involves teachers by combining top-down government directives with bottom-up teachers-based creativities. More explicitly, the paper aims at exploring and identifying perceptions of secondary school EFL teachers' on their implementation of 2003 curriculum reform. The paper also aims at revealing barriers to their autonomy and involvement in curriculum development in order to pave the way for an understanding and planning towards such involvement. The critical paradigm was the conceptual framework guiding the research with data availed through a questionnaire for teachers and interviews with EFL secondary education inspectors. The findings advocated the existence of imbalanced power relation between the government and teachers with the former controlling and dictating curriculum, and excluding teachers from the whole developmental process.

AB  - Community colleges are viewed as essential in the preparation of skilled science professionals in the U.S., and research regarding instructor impacts on student attitudes toward science are timely and relevant. This study explored specific instructor characteristics and pedagogical behaviors and their influence student engagement, confidence, and motivation to study science. A phenomenological approach was employed with elements of grounded theory. Data were collected from 12 community college students through semi-structured interviews. An explanatory framework for instructor characteristics that affected students' academic attitudes focused upon engagement and confidence. Students' impressions of instructors' behaviors and attitudes reinforced the complexity of factors that affected their motivation. Instructors played a crucial role in building confidence, making disciplinary relevance explicit, and maintaining interest in science. Students valued instructors who were knowledgeable, caring, accessible, encouraging, and democratic. Students appreciated those who promoted a growth mind-set and autonomy, yet were still available as a supportive individuals. Future interventions should be implemented to address issues with the science course interest of community college students, and impacts on confidence and persistence. Informing instructors and policy makers that improvements in community college teaching techniques and support structures can enhance science attitudes is essential in students persisting in the pipeline, joining the STEM workforce, or transferring to four-year colleges. Understanding community college student characteristics can lead to customization of methods, objectives, and supportive policies to meet student needs, which may provide a well-equipped talent resource for participation in STEM careers.

AB  - This article explores depictions of religion and religious topics in children's biographies included on the National Science Teacher's Association's Outstanding Science Trade Books for Students K-12 lists from 2011 through 2017. While disagreements and controversies about the role of religion in U.S. public schools are not new, these debates have experienced a resurgence in recent years due, in part, to the increased emphasis placed upon science as a content area. As a vital component of transformative, democratic, justice-oriented education, educators have a responsibility to validate and honor their students' religious liberties, and understand and respect a variety of different belief systems. And yet, teachers often report feeling unprepared and even afraid to discuss religions in public school settings. Grounded in the belief that all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, is socially constructed, this article explores the ways in which these topics are taken up in children's books that have been identified as exemplary and recommended for classroom use.

AB  - Purpose: This research aimed to determine school happiness level of the teachers based on their opinions. For this purpose, 'School Happiness Scale' was developed by the researchers. The validity and reliability of the School Happiness Scale were tested. And then, the scale was applied to 484 teachers to determine their school happiness level. Research Method: In the study, a quantitative research design was employed during the data collection and the analysis phases. Results: The School Happiness Scale consists of 26 items and five sub-factors. The item-total correlations range from 0.54 to 0.86. The five factors explain 65.09% of the total variance. The results showed that teachers perceived moderate level of school happiness in some sub-dimensions such as 'physical equipment', and 'activities'. They also perceived high level of school happiness in 'collaboration', and 'school management' sub-themes. The scores varied according to the school type and teaching field variables. Implications for Research and Practice: The results revealed that the school principals should encourage teachers, and display democratic and fair school management attitudes to increase school happiness. The top managers can elaborate to enhance the physical conditions of the schools. In order to increase school happiness of teachers, the collaboration can be improved among the members of school community. School Happiness Scale can be applied to different participants, and so the school happiness levels of the teachers as well as the validity and reliability scores of scale can be measured.

AB  - The term "school discipline" includes student self-management, classroom management, behaviour management, and school exclusion practices. This article is based on the perspectives of rangatahi on disciplinary practices from two different high schools. Ten Years 9-11 students from one school who had experienced exclusion, and 10 fully engaged Year 13 students in another school reflected on their strategic navigation of the culture of classroom and school discipline. Students were aware of how to exercise agency within their school's disciplinary regime and called for more democratic and equitable processes and dialogical relationships with their teachers.

AB  - European quality framework for early childhood education and care calls for creating environments that support all children's sense of belonging. This study aims to advance empirical knowledge on educators' interpretations of children's belonging in early education settings. The study is part of a project conducted in five European countries -- Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The following research question guides the study: How do educators interpret children's belonging in early education across borders? The study draws from the theory of the politics of belonging by Yuval-Davis and employs 'thinking and talking with an image' as a methodological approach. The findings explicate educators' taken-for-granted categorisations, thus portraying their views about educational settings as sites for children's belonging. Opposing, joint play and being alone were identified as emotionally loaded interactions that educators interpreted as significant for children's belonging. The educators emphasised democratic values, such as diversity, participation, equality and equity. However, they viewed diverse tensions in embodying democratic values in a diverse group. The shared basis of the profession appeared as a more significant basis for educators' interpretations than the different societal contexts. The study encourages educators and researchers in European countries to collaborate in promoting children's belonging.

AB  - Philosophy for Democracy is a research project that aims to examine whether and how Philosophy with Children contributes to the development of democratic skills and attitudes. In the Netherlands, as in almost all Western countries, Philosophy with Children is linked with the movement for citizenship education. This article reports the research on the practice of Philosophy with Children. Sixteen philosophical inquiries by children in the classroom were recorded, transcribed and analysed. The analyses show that children develop relevant reasoning skills and advanced dialogical skills. The study shows that embedding Philosophy with Children in a democratic practice is necessary for contributing to a critical-democratic citizenship development. The study also shows that Dutch children often give their opinion, but are not often involved in inquiring their own opinions. From a pedagogical point of view, we think that in Dutch culture and in Dutch schools it would be important to stress more a dialogical--community-based--inquiring attitude.

AB  - Teaching democratic citizenship has never been more vital, particularly given the dismissive attitude and direct attempts to undermine democratic institutions exemplified by the Trump administration. In addition, traditional approaches to teaching citizenship foreground the underlying values of self-governance, knowledge of the different branches of government, and the skills for behaving within this system (i.e., voting) but lack a broader intellectual framework to guide those actions (Parker, "Teaching democracy: Unity and diversity in public life," 2003). Parker, a critical multicultural educator, argued that this approach has rendered participatory citizenship superfluous and ignores more central concerns, namely, how people can live together justly while honoring their multiple individual and group identities (i.e., gender, race, class, religion, etc.). This essay focuses on the task of living together justly and offers one example of how this might be promoted through the communication studies curriculum.

AB  - This article refers to the South African Design teachers' attitudes towards the implementation of the 2020 Section 4 amendments of the Design Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS). The purpose of the article is twofold: first to establish the necessity for "awareness" of the teachers' attitudes towards curriculum changes, especially when they are unexpected and abrupt. Secondly, to demonstrate the importance of "awareness" among educational authorities about the role of transparent discussions on the nature, purpose, and consequences of their relevant decisions before their final implementation. To this end, the article discusses the amendments and their differences to the former curriculum. The role of the Design teachers' positive attitude towards curriculum changes, especially in dealing with challenging pedagogical issues and communicating creative motivation to learners, is critically assessed. Theoretically, the study was guided by "Ubuntu" philosophy and the South African democratic principles while methodologically, based on a qualitative data collection process, the "attitudes" of Design teachers from seven selected schools have been individually examined. In conclusion, the teachers' heterogeneous responses have indicated that their opinions do not reflect the "à priori" governmental acceptance of the amendments.

AB  - The enactment of everyday democratic practice in early childhood settings supports children to practise being active agents in their own lives. Through learning to take action on matters of importance, practising collaboration and listening, and seeing that their ideas matter and have significance, children are positioned to become engaged citizens. This article follows the work of four teachers at one centre, sharing four episodes of their teaching where democratic practice is evident.

AB  - The global shift toward neoliberalism, which frames the education of young children through markets, credentials, and individualism, creates a range of challenges for those who call for and seek out democratic teaching practices that strive to address the sociocultural worlds of the children in their programs. This article begins to address this issue. It does so by examining the findings from a qualitative case study that investigated how the practical conceptions of sample of early childhood graduate students in the United States were affected by developing and implementing a learning activity with children that reflected issues central to their lives in and/or outside their classrooms. Investigating and analyzing their experiences provide members of the early childhood community with steps they might take to assist early educators in framing their roles as teachers through democratic conceptions of practice that they can then implement within their early education context.

AB  - This study explores a group of social studies teachers' conceptions of citizenship by taking into consideration the country's increasingly authoritarian political culture. It offers an analysis of semi-structured interviews carried out with 20 teachers working at state middle schools in a relatively secular city. The study found that the majority of the teachers are subscribed to a non-democratic conception of citizenship that prioritizes an uncritical loyalty to the nation, inculcates passive compliance, relies on a pro-Muslim notion of human rights, and makes little room for political issues discussion. Despite that, some teachers seem to develop oppositional discourses and seek ways to claim their agencies. The study concludes that the authoritarian Islamic nationalism in power has intensified the ethno-religiously nationalist, statist, and duty-centric aspects of citizenship education (CE). Some teachers' explicit emphasis on pro-Islamic and anti-western discourses and almost all teachers' explicit concern to stay away from politics emerge as novel characteristics that are consistent with the dictates of Turkey's authoritarian regime. It seems authoritarian populist nationalism redresses citizenship as an exclusionary notion grounded in race, ethnicity, religion, and civilizational claims. Insights from this research may help the advocates keep CE supportive of democratic values under authoritarian conditions.

AB  - This article focuses on the assessment of the progress made on the provisioning of quality education at selected public schools in Limpopo province. Qualitative research methodology was used as the author was interested in collecting data on the experiences, perceptions, and views of the research participants. Three research instruments for data collection were employed, namely participant observation, document analysis, and interviews. Purposive sampling was used to select participants who were likely to be knowledgeable and experienced on the phenomenon under study. Ten educators were sampled from public primary and secondary schools. The findings revealed that after the 1994 democratic elections in South Africa, few changes on the provisioning of quality education in Limpopo Province happened. The negative attitudes of the educators towards transformational policies, lack of competency of the educators in teaching reading and numeracy, lack of equitable distribution of resources to public schools, and lack of induction and in-service training of educators were amongst the contributing factors hampering effective provisioning of quality education. The author recommends recruitment of highly qualified and experienced educators, induction of newly appointed educators, continuous in-service training and mentoring, and development of guidelines or prescripts on the implementation of education policies as the tools that can enhance the provisioning of quality education at public schools.

Through their concept of articulation, Laclau and Mouffe attempt to liberate Gramsci's theory of hegemony from Marxist economism, and adapt it to a political sphere inhabited by a plurality of struggles and agents none of which is predominant. However, while for Gramsci the political process of hegemony formation has an explicit educational dimension, Laclau and Mouffe ignore this dimension altogether. My discussion starts with elaborating the concept of articulation and analysing it in terms of three dimensions: performance, connection and transformation. I then address the role of education in Gramsci's politics, in which the figure of the intellectual is central, and argue that radical democratic education requires renouncing that figure. In the final section, I offer a theory of such education, in which both teacher and students articulate their political differences and identities.

AB  - This article explores the leading ideas of the Ukrainian educators and the reform of school education in the era of the Ukrainian revolution (1917-1921), in the context of the values of both Europe and the wider world. Under Soviet rule (1921-1991), this period was obscured by a false narrative, but with the proclamation of Ukraine's independence in 1991, this page of history has been rightfully restored in the scientific space of a democratic state. For the international audience, it will be interesting to study the use of world pedagogical thought during the development of Ukrainian education more than a hundred years ago as an example of great expectations and subsequent lost hopes. School education in Ukraine should be based on national, humanist and democratic principles. Unfortunately, the Ukrainian revolution was defeated, and Bolshevik forces captured Ukraine; nevertheless, its democratic achievements laid the foundations for the creation of the national education system in modern independent Ukraine.

AB  - Steven Drouin writes that in his first years of teaching, he viewed the purpose of school to be what his childhood teachers and college instructors had instilled in him. School was simply a place for learning academic content and for developing skills needed later in life. Then he began to realize that any conception of schooling that required them to wait--to put off addressing their problems until later in life--was ill suited. Instead, he needed to find a different conceptualization of the purpose of school, that challenged students and teachers to focus on solving problems, not later in life, but now. Paulo Freire's (1970) "problem-posing education", which stands in opposition to the banking model of education articulated an alternative purpose for school. Freire insisted that instead of starting from the arrogant assumption that "the teacher knows everything and the students know nothing, should instead start with the students. In short, rather than telling students what to know, educators should ask questions: What do you want to do? Where do you want to go? Who do you want to become? Then, let the answers to those questions guide what is taught. Freire's model of school engenders a new relationship between teachers, students, content, and the broader community as a whole. Problem-posing education follows three general phases: identification of the problem, analysis of the causes of the problem, and finding solutions to the problem (Freire, 1970, 1973; Solórzano, 1989). In this scenario, school would function as a means for students to reflect and act upon their own problems. Freire (1970) wrote, "[Students] posed with problems relating to themselves in the world will feel increasingly challenged and obliged to respond to that challenge." The result is a new, more authentic, more democratic relationship forged by using school to focus on student-generated problems. Drouin found that aspiring to follow Friere's ideals in his own school, and enacting such a repurposing was daunting in both the ideological and logistical challenges it posed. Drouin writes in this article that the problem he formulated in order to first challenge himself was this: How should he implement a problem-based education as a means of encouraging students to become more active democratic citizens today. This is the kind of professional question one never expects to answer fully, however in this article Drouin explains Freire's three phases and notes that they have become an essential element to his own planning, and reflecting process.

AB  - This qualitative study examines teacher educators' articulations about their beliefs and motivations for preparing the next generation of teachers. The study also explores how teacher educators conceptualise their roles as the teachers of prospective teachers. Employing case study design, the participants included 10 teacher educators who serve at a highly selective, public, research university in Turkey. The data were collected through semi-structured and in-depth individual interviews. Adopting critical pedagogy as the theoretical framework, the interviews were analyzed by content analysis method with the help of NVivo 10 qualitative data analysis software. The results showed that the teacher educators specifically saw their roles as enacting change, advocating for democracy, equity, and social justice, and promoting the improvement and welfare of societies, in an effort to bring more emancipatory educational practices in the society through pre-service teacher education. This study furthers our understanding of how teacher education programs could improve their professional preparation and practices to push the agenda for social justice and equity in K-12 schools.

AB  - Scraton's [1992. "Shaping up to womanhood: Gender and girls' physical education." Open University Press] ground breaking research highlighted how Physical Education (PE) contributed to the reproduction of gender power relations; more specifically, how three messages around motherhood, sexuality and physicality, reflected through PE's structures, activities and delivery, contributed to young women's sense of self. Twenty five years on, this paper explores how contemporary PE reproduces and challenges gender power relations in four English secondary schools. Data were generated from eighty hours of observations of PE lessons, and eight semi-structured interviews with PE teachers. Guided by Hill Collins' [2000. "Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment." Routledge] four domains (structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, interpersonal) underpinning the matrix of domination the findings demonstrate that gender remains a visible organising feature in the structural arrangements of PE. Moreover, teachers' gendered beliefs and assumptions circulating within the hegemonic domain, and actions in the disciplinary domain, ensure that students embody their gender in appropriate ways. Furthermore, a consistency of practice was evident in teachers' pedagogy despite differences in the schools' cohorts. Similar blocks of teaching activities and a performance-based pedagogy failed to include difference. We suggest this is unsurprising and unlikely to change with the current National Curriculum promoting a performative, PE as sport discourse, and teacher training not conducive to developing teachers who can engage with difference and challenge inequalities. As such, PE continues to reinforce gender power relations and gender differences. By drawing upon the matrix, the need for change to occur at different levels and contexts is identified. To this end, teacher training must do better in developing the next generation of teachers who are willing and able to critique the status quo and work with girls to advocate for change. Relatedly, we draw attention to what can be achieved when power is shared through a democratic pedagogy that values girls' voices and recognises them as co-collaborators in curriculum design.

AB  - The rise of various conspiracy theories has left many Americans worried and wondering about the future of democracy. Education has been singled out as part of the solution. Linking Dewey's conception of the purpose of education as growth, the happiness of "eudaimonia," to "pursuit of happiness" as a human right, the author explores recent research related to what education and educators can do to weaken conspiracy thinking while also considering ways of building and strengthening understanding of and commitment to democracy as a distinctive way of life. Noting that democracy is not natural and that the central problem with conspiracy theories is that they undermine human growth, the argument is that rather than bulk up the civics curriculum what is needed most is to rethink the kind and quality of life lived within schools understood as a "special environment," as Dewey said, one within which democracy is both studied and practiced.

AB  - Equity is desirable in all aspects of our democracy. Public schools, in particular, are essential to that enterprislse. Unfortunately, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) educators have often not experienced equity in our schools. Equity-oriented school leaders, however, can make schools more equitable for LGBT teachers while increasing student achievement. The research reported here examines LGBT teachers' perceptions of equity in their workplace--our schools--and, particularly, their sense of safety. Implications for equity-oriented school leaders are discussed.

AB  - Research shows that teachers and educators struggle to act when conflict appears in the classroom. This article argues that (political) conflict should not be avoided or eradicated. Teachers should enable conflict and attend to their pupils in the process, in order to enable further understanding of each other and their differences, as part of living together in a plural and diverse society. Scholars and educators often take a deliberative approach to citizen education by focusing on problem solving and consensus seeking. This article explores how conflict can be educational if we accept that antagonisms are inherent parts of human relations. The aim of this paper is not to propose moral boundaries to conflicts. Instead, it wants to contribute to a shift from teaching citizenship as conflict-free space towards learning democracy, in which educational conflict, or "friction," is seen as an important part of the political education of pupils. This paper uses democratic theory, narrative theory, and the cultural-historical theory of play as described by Dutch historian Johan Huizinga, to construct analytical tools to further understand conflict in the classroom.

AB  - This research aimed to reveal the views of secondary school students on ideal teacher qualifications. For this purpose, research was carried out in a phenomenological pattern, which is one of the qualitative research methods. The study was carried out with 76 students who were studying in a secondary school in the 2017-2018 academic year. The data were obtained with the repertory grid technique and interview technique. As a result of the analysis of the data, it was seen that the qualifications of the teachers considered ideal by the participants were among the general competencies of the teaching profession. According to the results of this research, ideally, teachers are expected to provide good and fun lessons, not discriminate among students, be friendly and calm in communications with students, and ensure discipline and democracy in the classroom environment.

AB  - Ecological and social risks are part of life on Earth, and yet they have increased during the late modern era due to environmental change and rising inequality. People who are well-educated are better able to plan for and respond to risk, both individually and collectively. Geography teachers' perceptions are critically analysed to examine the contemporary approach to risk education. There can be drawbacks of focusing on risks, including the emphasis on negative futures that could dissuade students from engaging with relevant issues. However, a range of advantages of risk education include engagement with important issues and concepts; learning about practical responses to relevant risks; higher order inquiry-based learning into societal issues; supporting resilience in students; and assistance with personal and democratic decision-making. The teachers' narratives on risk education are used to frame a critical discussion on the roles of the formal education system to prepare students for uncertain futures. The teachers recognised the need for more risk education to prepare students for a second modernity, but cautioned that teaching and learning approaches must focus on appropriate, relevant issues to provide opportunities to imagine and enact hopeful futures.

AB  - High-quality civic learning opportunities remain the exception, rather than the norm, in public schools across the country. The health and future of the American democracy is dependent on all its public schools to foster democratic classrooms and prepare informed citizens--a reality far from realized in this third decade of the 21st century. Through an inductive analysis of in-depth interviews, this article makes visible how educators conceptualize civic teaching and learning in the political moment of the year 2020. Because of the known link between teachers' conceptualizations, instructional visions, and their practice, it is necessary when engaged in any district change effort to first understand how teachers understand the existing phenomenon--in this case, civic teaching and learning. In shedding light on teachers' contemporary conceptualizations of civic teaching and learning, this article contributes to the necessary and timely conversation on how to support civic teaching, even in politically contentious times, so that all students can experience high-quality civic learning on a routine basis.

AB  - This report documents and compares two cases of pre-service elementary teachers' beliefs about democracy and education for democracy in the USA and Bosnia and Herzegovina along with contextual factors influencing the similarities and differences among these beliefs. Findings suggest that US pre-service elementary teachers have a self-proclaimed lack of knowledge about democracy and primarily view citizenship education as a means to teach children how to get along. Conversely, Bosnian pre-service teachers hold more nuanced views of democracy and education for democracy, formed while their country transitioned from socialism towards democracy following a devastating civil war. Consequently, they focus on teaching children the skills and dispositions necessary for successful democratic citizenship to preserve their country. These divergent understandings of democracy within the two cases may hold potential benefits to teachers in both emergent and established democracies. Implications of these and other findings are discussed, as well as potential future research.

AB  - Context: School-based student protests have received little scholarly attention, yet they have the potential to impact the school community, students' civic development, and larger social movements. Principals are key actors in responding to school-based student protests. As school leaders, principals' actions affect the outcome of student protests and shape many students' first experiences as activists. Purpose: This study examines U.S. public high school principals' responses to schoolbased student protests in 2018, a year of heightened protest activity in response to gun violence in schools. The purpose of our study is to understand how a national sample of principals responded to student protests and to quantify general trends in their responses. Research Design: Using a mixed methods approach, we surveyed 491 principals during the summer of 2018; follow-up interviews were conducted with 38 principals. Analyses are grounded in the Deter-Manage-Educate framework, a new conceptual framework that we develop in this paper, organized around the three broad goals principals pursue when responding to student protests. Using this framework, we determined "how" and "how many" principals deterred, managed, and educated. Results: Findings show that very few principals outright "deterred" student protests. Nearly all principals "managed" by setting parameters around protests in an effort to balance students' right to free speech with concerns for order and safety. A majority of principals also "educated," using student protest as an opportunity to encourage civic development. Our findings suggest that an important distinction exists between principals who "channel" students toward (or away from) a particular manner of protest and principals who "facilitate reflection" to help students realize their own vision of civic engagement. Implications: This study has implications not only for principals, but also for district leaders and educational leadership organizations: Although many principals receive support for managing the logistical (and legal) challenges of responding to student protests, more attention needs to be directed toward helping principals leverage the educative opportunities that student protest can provide.

AB  - The incidences of suicides by students from marginalized communities at Indian public universities indicate that the structural reforms have been insufficient in bringing social justice at universities and the situation demands a change in cognitive structures and processes that can mobilize shift towards just relations at the universities. This article aims to reflect upon pedagogy of consciousness developed by Paulo Freire and argue for its adoption by teachers to develop student voice that has the potential to bring social justice from within the universities. Following the interpretivist paradigm, the idea of the university given by Kant is explored to locate student voice and social justice within the framework of universities. The idea though places voice at core of university teaching learning process, limits its democratic potential by assuming apolitical role of the universities. Therefore, the author elaborates upon pedagogy of consciousness by Paulo Freire, to bring out its relevance in developing voice for social justice and rethinking the idea of the university. Through the analysis of in-depth interviews conducted with teachers and students at University of Delhi, the voices of students citing incidences of structural as well as epistemic injustice in the University are highlighted to develop the link between theory and practice. These voices point towards lack of spaces for expression of dissenting voices and understanding of these voices by teachers and students from privileged backgrounds. The article concludes with illustrating, how pedagogy of consciousness can develop this consciousness enabling praxis of transformation that brings political dissenting voices to the core of the idea of the university in democracy.

AB  - Background/Context: Students' perceptions of justice, fairness, and order within their schools are arguably key building blocks of socialization to participation within a democratic society. The ideals of justice, fairness, and order within their schools are particularly imperative because the educational system is founded on a belief of democracy and meritocracy. It is also known that students' perceptions of school justice can vary by race, ethnicity, and gender. What remains uncertain is how the fastest growing segment of the United States, students in immigrant families, perceive the school justice, fairness, and order within their school. Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore if straight-line assimilation, segmented assimilation, and immigrant optimism hypotheses explain the relationships between schools, justice, and immigration, as well as the potential role of gender, race, and ethnicity in immigrant youth perceptions of justice, fairness, and order. Participants/Subjects: This study utilizes the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), a nationally representative sample of high school sophomores. Research Design: This study's research design includes statistical analysis of secondary data. Findings/Results: Findings do suggest that the students' perceptions of justice, fairness, and order are indeed moderated by immigrant generation, race, ethnicity, and gender. Conclusions/Recommendations: Educators and educational researchers who are seeking to better understand the schooling experiences of immigrant youth might benefit from questioning assimilation and Americanization as processes that inevitably promote educational progress. Given that immigrant youth are and have historically been marginalized within U.S. schools, it appears that socialization, Americanization, gender, and immigrant generational status are germane to creating democratic education for all students. Attentiveness to democratic school justice, order, and fairness is, therefore, imperative.

AB  - This study explores how globalization, migration, and citizenship education intersect in four northwest European democracies. In this study of secondary schools serving students from immigrant backgrounds in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (England and Scotland), I interviewed teachers and students and observed civic-related lessons. Using a socio-cultural, ecological theory of civic education in an era of transnationalism and attending to the historical and socio-cultural contexts in the four countries, I focused on transnational students and the content and teaching methods prevalent in their social studies classes, as well as whole school civic practices. I found transnational student identities were complex, fluid, and situational, and the students frequently communicated across national borders with relatives in their heritage countries and worldwide diasporic communities. Teachers and schools approached civic education in ways that reflected national pedagogical cultures; yet, across countries, teachers identified similar opportunities and challenges in preparing transnational youth for participatory democratic citizenship.

AB  - As a philosophical basis of education, 'love' is crucial to early childhood education. For this reason, early childhood education should cultivate young children's loving attitudes. Hence, by analysing related work, this paper explored how love-based relationships may be developed between preschool teachers and young children in early childhood education. The methods are as follows: (1) fostering love in preschool teachers' hearts; (2) creating loving relationships between preschool teachers and young children; (3) providing opportunities for young children to practice loving behaviour; (4) giving young children freedom; (5) maintaining an open dialogue; (6) emphasising democratic participation; (7) avoiding indoctrination; (8) respecting young children's experiences and discoveries; (9) allowing young children to make choices and (10) understanding young children as individuals.

AB  - A pedagogical formation certificate is required to become a teacher in secondary schools in Turkey. This certificate program, which is required to obtain in addition to a bachelor's degree from any faculty other than the education faculties, aims at providing the knowledge, capabilities and attitudes required by the profession of teaching. This study aims at determining the perceptions of prospective teachers attending the pedagogical formation program about the properties of a good teacher. Data were collected using a survey comprising an open-ended question and content analysis was conducted to obtain the themes in this study, which adopted a descriptive method. Based on the properties of a good teacher, expressed by the prospective teachers, the themes "personal characteristics", "enforcement of teaching process", "establishing a democratic classroom environment" and "assessment and evaluation" are obtained.

AB  - Classroom management is sometimes dismissed as behaviorist or even oppressive. However, as scholars concerned with issues of equity, we cannot afford to avoid the complexity of authority relationships in urban schools. Doing so undermines our ability to effectively combat the influx of authoritarian disciplinary approaches into these schools and to prepare new urban teachers for the challenges of classroom leadership. In the hopes of furthering consideration of these topics, this article highlights two distinct perspectives on equitable classroom management in urban schools: one emphasizing democratic classrooms, the other emphasizing teacher authority. Though these perspectives may seem contradictory, I argue that a conception of classroom management that incorporates "both" democracy and authority is critical to effectively addressing the issues highlighted above. Drawing upon theoretical conceptions of authority, studies examining the significance of racial and cultural differences in classroom management, and literature on restorative justice in education, I propose a framework that integrates these two perspectives. This framework suggests that rather than working in opposition to one another, democracy and authority are two sides of the same coin, and one may not be fully possible without the other.

AB  - Education is a vehicle that can be used to oppress or liberate people in the society. Schools are places where democratic values are instilled into the individual learners. Teachers are curriculum implementers who play significant roles in instilling the democratic ideals. The purpose of this study was to investigate in-service student teachers' perceptions of the extent to which democracy ideals are practicable in Botswana primary/elementary classrooms. The data were collected through written reflective essays from 25 bachelor of education final year in-service student teachers at the University of Botswana and two focus groups of 10 participants each. The findings of the study revealed that the promotion of democratic ideals in the classroom is a challenge. The emergent themes and reasons for this challenge is due to centralized curriculum-driven examinations, high student-teacher ratios, and a shortage of materials. The in-service teachers voiced a need for adherence to democratic ideals and concluded that infusion of those principles would result in learner friendly schools that develop critical thinkers who are self-reliant, and active participates in making decisions that affect their lives, thereby furthering the development of democracy in Botswana.

AB  - Dissent is vital to the intellectual life of a classroom, just as it is to the health of a school, a school system, or a democracy, explains high school teacher Mike Miller. Rather than being silenced, healthy dissidence should be taught. Miller draws from his classroom experience to illustrate how educators can cultivate a climate that welcomes dissent.

AB  - Engaging today's youth in civil discussions of contentious issues remains both a crucial element in democratically oriented education and extremely challenging to facilitate. The purpose of this article, which documents and presents pilot study findings from a dance workshop that engaged practicing teachers surrounding the issue of immigration, is to understand how dance can be integrated into the curriculum to prepare students to engage in democratic deliberation. Data collection consisted of pre- and post-workshop interviews with participants and was analyzed based on common principles of democracy and democratic education found in the literature. Findings point to the important role that dance could have in developing the trust, empathy, and reflectiveness necessary to engage in civil dialogue that is the essential foundation of a democratic society.

AB  - This article examines how the actors of a Chilean public high school navigated the political scenario produced when its students decided to occupy their school to protest a national Educational Reform. Using ethnographic data and interviews with high school students, it proposes to understand this process in the context of a figured world directly linked with youth activism and student contentious politics: that of 'Student Democracy'. The article argues that this figured world is constantly being produced by students, teachers and parents engaging in contentious local practices and that, in doing so, they create new opportunities for political action and citizenship education within school settings. It also argues that, by engaging with this figured world, students are participating in both 'Student Democracy' and the broader societal democracy, learning to be citizens in the present, and to deal with the possibilities, risks, and responsibilities that democratic participation always entails.

AB  - In multicultural contexts, school principals and educators face unique challenges integrating disadvantaged and immigrant youth. We investigate how these leaders advocate, design and implement social justice pedagogies for inclusion. Drawing on an interdisciplinary literature and in-depth interviews with school principals in Melilla (Spain), we further explore the social justice ideologies and practices of leaders in culturally diverse, minority-majorityschools. The findings reveal that intercultural education and ICT both enhance the inclusion of students and families, transforming schools into more open, democratic, learning environments. However, scarce funding resources, exacerbated by Melilla's remote location from its Central Ministry of Education and the limited bargaining power of leaders, often truncate social justice initiatives.

AB  - In the simplest term, democracy may be defined as a set of views and standards towards freedom, however it includes an array of approaches which have been framed over the history of mankind. In short, democracy is the systematized form of freedom. A democratic country is not possible without the freedom of expression. Freedom of expression fosters publics to clearly put forward their demands on how the authorities should perform their duties. Thus, this study inquires the visionary underpinnings of third persons in a phenomenological custom. The data of the study were gathered through a questionnaire designed by Yildirim and Türkoglu (2017) and semi-structured interview questions structured by the researchers. Through a mix method research design, this paper employed both qualitative and quantitative ways to collect the required data. 180 EFL prep-class students at a state university in Turkey participated in the study. 160 of the informants responded to the questionnaire while 20 informants answered the semi-structured interview questions. Convenience sampling, where the very first accessible data is employed, was utilized in the study. The findings of the study show that the need of democratic participation is felt in EFL classrooms. Related implications to raise the awareness of EFL students and teachers on democracy and democratic citizenship were given at the end of the paper.

AB  - Teachers play a crucial role in the political socialization of adolescents. Using Q-Methodology, we explored high school teachers' conceptions of good citizenship in post-genocide Rwanda. Teachers ranked 50 statements, describing a 'good citizen', on a 9-column grid, anchored by 'least important citizenship behaviour' and 'most important citizenship behaviour'. The four perspectives that emerged viewed good citizenship as (a) being mindful or considerate of the 1994 genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi and promoting unity as well as reconciliation among Rwandans; (b) being morally upright and demonstrating a strong sense of patriotism; (c) being politically enthusiastic; and (d) promoting justice. The study argues for a shift towards more critical forms of citizenship. It also advocates the reinforcement of democratic and participatory skills among teachers.

AB  - Policymakers across the globe continue to promote access to early education programmes as a means to improve children's readiness for school. Many of their reforms are rooted in a neoliberal conception of governance that frames policy solutions through economic rather than democratic terms. Such policies foster an image of the successful learner as one who becomes an earner and consumer rather than an active member of the larger democratic society. This shift in the conception of publicly supported early education affects teachers of young children in multiple ways. This article examines how a sample of early educators in the USA responded to a set of neoliberal reforms in their pre-kindergarten teaching context. Examining their responses, which ultimately mimicked their policy-makers' neoliberal reforms, reveals the subtlety of these policies in overtaking their attempts to resist them. It also illuminates the challenges they and other early educators face as policy-makers' neoliberal policies continue to alter the purpose and direction of early childhood. Finally, it ends by considering the ways in which early educators working in similar contexts might respond to and navigate such reforms.

AB  - This article studies the dialogues, agreements, and actions in defence of a fairer and more inclusive school, carried out during ethnographic research in a Spanish rural school between 2019 and 2021, the period in which an ethnographer accompanied the professional work of the school principal, also the tutor of a class group. The research is carried out from a critical approach and uses participant observation, informal interview and document analysis. During the research process, we observed and participated in the development of three major patterns for social justice and the construction of a democratic and inclusive school in the case studied: the strengthening of the opening of the school doors; the promotion of horizontality in leadership relations in the school, and the promotion of collaborative educational strategies in the classroom.

AB  - Over the last decade in the context of collapsing trust in major public and private institutions, Chilean society has engaged in massive social mobilizations culminating in 2019 with widespread rioting in rebellion against the neoliberal model. This socio-political crisis raises the general question which this article addresses: How does such a fluid political, highly mobilized, and polarized social context influence school citizenship education? Focusing on features of curriculum and teacher-held beliefs regarding democratic principles and forms of political participation, a mixed-methods approach produces evidence which makes visible a consistent pattern of influence. First, we find evidence of an orientation in the curriculum towards critical active citizenship with a parallel silencing of key democratic processes and skills, like voting and deliberation. Second, we reveal a complex and ambivalent set of beliefs among teachers which combine both community and contentious--even illegal--forms of political participation, on the one hand, and formal political participation through voting as key, on the other.

AB  - In the following interview, Meira Levinson (Harvard Graduate School) discusses the field of educational ethics and how it can enhance justifiable youth activism to enact citizenship education and recover democracy. She introduces readers to her philosophical approach for developing normative case studies that aim to be inclusive of divergent views on knowledge and value in schooling. Professor Levinson visited the School of Education at the University of Newcastle, Australia, in August 2018, to advise the Educational Ethics: Dilemmas of Diversity Network project team. During her visit she discussed with local teachers and school leaders about how educational practices can ethically address differences, diversities and decision-making in pluralist democracies.

AB  - In this article, we explain how mindfulness can enhance a democratic way of being, connecting practices of awareness, reflection, dialog, and action to democratic citizenship and social arrangements. We begin by sharing our understanding of democracy as a philosophy and a political system. We then provide a background for the concept of mindfulness as it is used by those in the field of education and health care and as we connect it to democracy and democratic education. We introduce a mindfulness pedagogy and use this pedagogy to develop our concept of mindfully democratic schools. We use the work of John Dewey and Paulo Freire, along with other philosophers of education, to address concerns that mindfulness is fundamentally an apolitical and individual practice rather than a social practice. We end by sharing how mindful practices are imagined and supported within democratic public schools with three vignettes from the Coalition of Essential Schools, whose vision and principles promote teachers' and students' mindfully democratic action. In doing this, we describe the types of schools that we see as necessary for our vision of democracy. We invite readers to offer their own stories of mindfully democratic schools.

AB  - This study aims to examine the meaning-making of parents in five Icelandic preschools concerning the collaboration between preschools and families. Further, the perspectives of educators on the views of the parents were also sought. The theoretical background was Moss's ideas of democratic early childhood education and MacNaughton's ideas of power relationships between parents and educators. Data were gathered in two steps: first, focus group interviews were conducted with parents; and second, focus group interviews were conducted with a group of preschool educators who reflected upon the parent interviews. The parents and educators seemed to have similar experiences and views of the parent-professional collaboration, and of the division of power and knowledge between the two groups. The type of collaboration the parents and the educators described is not in line with democratic preschool pedagogy as explained by Moss. The parents from other cultures who participated in the study were in a marginalised position, and the educators seemed to be unsure about how to communicate with and accommodate families from cultures different from their own. The study reveals power relationships on many levels in the preschool community.

AB  - This study aims to examine primary school students' academic achievement and motivation in terms of parental attitudes, teacher motivation, teacher self-efficacy and leadership perception. Research model of the study is designed as descriptive research model and the data are collected from 60 primary school teachers teaching 4th grade students in 2017-2018 academic year and from 1476 4th grade primary school students. The findings of the study show that fathers' having a high level of education, teachers' having a high level of motivation, a democratic attitude in family are some factors positively affecting student achievement. The findings also indicate that democratic parental attitude and a high level of teacher motivation increase student motivation. It is also concluded that neglectful parental attitude negatively affects student achievement and motivation. Accepted or distributed leadership approach in the school influences teacher motivation. The findings show that teachers with high self-efficacy also have high level of motivation. It is also concluded that teachers at the first years of their career have lower level of motivation. The study is believed to be a guiding example for other studies analyzing similar topics.

AB  - Collaboration among Indigenous Peoples and the Saskatchewan government in Canada has led to Indigenous K-12 education progress concerning First Nations and Métis peoples, the Indigenous populations whose traditional territories exist within Saskatchewan. Acknowledging such advancements, this paper is concerned with how white identified students continue to graduate with higher completion and achievement rates than Métis and First Nations students. Critical race theory (CRT) can assist with understanding how racialised statistics persist in spite of decades of government administered Indigenous education initiatives and mandates. Contributing to anti-racist informed Indigenous education scholarship, this study applies aspects of CRT scholar Cheryl Harris's whiteness as property theory to a qualitative critical race methodological analysis of 13 Métis teachers' K-12 stories of racism. When viewed from a CRT lens, the findings suggest Métis teachers' experiences with racism in K-12 schools can contribute to our understanding of how to ensure democratic and racially just practices.

AB  - The narrowing of the school curriculum in the USA, the UK and Australia to support subjects of perceived economic importance has seen a renewed interest in the educational philosophy of John Dewey (1859-1952), (Elliott, 2012; Englund; 2016, Woodford, 2012). An ever-increasing number of secondary school students, especially in the USA, are now unable to pursue their aspirations in disciplines that are not considered essential learning, for example music and art education (Burke, 2015; Hansen & James, 2016). Progressive educators contend that if a more civilized and democratic society is to develop, the principles of democratic education delineated by Dewey in the first half of the twentieth century need to be reestablished in schools (Hansen & James, 2016). Current educational rationales give students very little opportunity to contribute to civic and community activities (Englund, Queennerstedt & Wahlström, 2009). Dissatisfaction with school music education in the USA, the UK and Australia to develop inclusive music policies in the recent past has seen a renewed interest by music educators and teachers in the work of Dewey (Elliott 2012; Dillon, 2005; Green, 2002; Woodford, 2014).

AB  - This study aims to refine our understanding of the potential perils and possibilities of national myths for democratic history education. Previous research studies in history education have often assumed that national myths are ideological constructs serving the interests of the privileged. This study examines national myths as empty signifiers responding to students' present demands. The focus is the case of Catalonia, where nationalism has recently grown. Based on interview (14) and questionnaire (340) data collected from Catalan secondary students, my analysis suggests that national myths can be open to existing contemporary demands against a powerful Other. As such, national myths can be considered an interface where history educators can intervene. National myths, and likely other myths and countermyths, might implicitly or explicitly exclude some students whilst providing others with a collective identity capable of political action.

AB  - This study intends to analyze the relation between school principals' leadership styles and teachers' perception of organizational cynicism. The study group consists of 268 participants teaching at high schools in the Balikesir district of Turkey during 2014-2015 academic year. In the study, which used relational survey model, data was collected through Democratic Leadership Scale and Organizational Cynicism Scale and analyzed by mean scores, independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and simple linear regression. The results revealed that democratic leadership is a significant predictor of organizational cynicism, and it is negatively connected with organizational cynicism. In addition, it was found that there were significant differences between seniority and gender groups as regards democratic leadership, between seniority groups as regards all dimensions of organizational cynicism, and between gender as regards affective cynicism. All the results of the study showed that the democratic leadership style displayed by school principals influences the organizational cynicism perceived by teachers.

AB  - Purpose: A comfortable and happy work environment, where all the teachers are sincere and true to each other and sure that what they say and do will not be used against them, is a basic need for a teacher. It is thought that meeting this expectation is up to the feeling of trust, especially in the principal, and then in colleagues and students and parents. The aim of the study is to reveal the relationship between school principals' leadership behaviors and teachers' organizational trust, and at what level leadership behaviors predict teachers' organizational trust. Research Methods: A correlational survey model was used to select participants (n = 722). Findings: The results show a significant and positive relationship between democratic leadership behaviors and all dimensions of organizational trust, while autocratic and laissez-faire leadership behaviors have a significant and negative relationship with all dimensions of organizational trust. When compared to autocratic and laissez-faire leadership behaviors, democratic leadership is the most significant predictor of principal trust. In addition, democratic leadership is the only significant and positive predictor of trust in colleagues, students, and parents, even though it is at a low level. Implications for Research and Practice: The results of the study show that democratic principal behaviors affect not only teachers' principal trust but also their trust in colleagues, students, and parents. Therefore, school principals should take education seminars to increase their awareness about the importance democratic leadership.

AB  - This article addresses key topics of academic freedom and critical pedagogy during a time of right-wing populist politics. The rise of the far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro to Brazil's presidency in 2019 was accompanied by a vow to eradicate any vestige of the ideas of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire from the country's schools. Bolsonaro's campaign was supported by ultra-conservative groups that have as their core mission a traditional Christian and anti-Communist educational agenda. At the forefront of these groups is the influential and conspicuous 'Escola sem Partido' (ESP) movement that has forcefully campaigned against Freire's critical pedagogy across the country and promoted physical and online abuse of teachers since 2014. This article asks how Freire's philosophies can be an ally in the struggle for democratic education in the current political climate in Brazil. It employs a method of dialogical narrative to bring Freire's theories and critical methodology to life and test their potency against the ESP educational philosophies. It initially employs Freire's core ideas to examine the ESP policies and parliamentary bills. In the second part, it analyses documents and online content produced by civil society resistance to ESP pressures. The findings show the vitality of Freire's pedagogical philosophy to empower oppressed communities in their demands for quality education. The narrative concludes by demonstrating the vital role of the critical consciousness process and of Freire's pedagogy of freedom to support ongoing struggles by teachers and communities to block ESP attempts to abolish critical thinking in Brazilian public education.

AB  - This is a study of 12,372 professors in 116 colleges that are the four top US News-ranked colleges in each of 30 states that collect political registration data. We devised the sample to highlight variation in registration arising from individual, college-level, and state-level characteristics. We find an overall Democratic-to-Republican registration ratio of 8.5:1, but age, gender, field, region, and religious affiliation modify the ratios of Democrats to Republicans. This is the first application of logistical modeling to archival faculty registration data. The logistical models mostly confirm the univariate findings but reveal that state- and college-level dummy variables retain their significance when individual, field, and college rank are controlled. Organizational cultures of academic institutions and state political cultures along with better-understood influences of personal and institutional characteristics may influence the propensity of colleges to engage in or deviate from preponderately Democratic hiring.

AB  - This paper, a critical examination of educational concepts, policies and practices, presents findings from research into the impact of accountability agendas on teacher professionalism and pedagogic practices. The study, theoretically framed through Halstead's notions of contractual and responsive accountability, and Gramsci's hegemonic practices, examined secondary arts teachers' pedagogical autonomy and professionalism in England and New Zealand. We provide an overview of current education policy contexts in both countries, and their impact upon secondary school arts education (years 11-16). Drawing from interview data from 15 England and New Zealand teachers, we offer a critique and innovative counter-narrative for the accountability measures currently dominating English schooling. Drawing together perspectives from both jurisdictions, we suggest more inclusive, democratic and responsive assessment and performative measures for the English context.

AB  - Museum educators and instructors of English as a Second Language (ESOL) at a community college in New York reflect on their experiences facilitating a program designed to enrich the language, cultural, and visual literacy skills of adult immigrant students. The CALTA21 program brought together three stakeholders, immigrant ESOL students, language instructors, and museum educators in collaboration to build linguistic, social, and cultural capital. A professional development institute, utilizing Visual Thinking Strategies as a core pedagogy, provided a common practice used by the stakeholders in the classroom and the museum. This democratic method subverted the traditional student-teacher relationship by using inquiry and personal narratives to inspire an exchange of ideas. The case study will consider the elements of the program that supported the development of a dynamic community of learners, and the empowering experience of teaching and learning within a model of shared authority.

AB  - This was a survey study aimed at finding out the perceptions of headteachers on the leadership styles of Junior High School (JHS) headteachers within the Ejisu-Juaben Municipality. The researchers selected 50 headteachers, purposively through census. A set of closed-ended questionnaire was used, and this comprised 67 items for the JHS headteacher respondents. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent t-test, and demographic analysis. The study found, among other things, that autocratic, situational and transactional leadership styles were perceived to be the predominant leadership styles practiced by the JHS heads. The study recommended, among other things, that headteachers should practice transformational and democratic leadership styles, and that the Ghana Education Service, policy makers and other stakeholders of education should strengthen the leadership component within the JHS system for effective realization of school objectives. In this respect, appointment of headship in the school setting, especially at the JHS, ought to be made in consideration of professional leadership training, aside other requirements.

AB  - Purpose: Public schools in a democracy should educate young people to develop the knowledge and dispositions of citizenship in order to foster a more inclusive society and ensure the continuation of the democratic republic. Conceptualizations of citizenship must be clearly framed in order to support civic engagement, in particular, civic engagement for social justice. Rarely do educational technology scholars or educators interrogate the International Society for Technology in Education definition of digital citizenship. Educational technologists should connect notions of civic engagement and conceptions of digital citizenship. Instead, the field continues to engage in research, policy and practice which disconnects these ideas. This suggests that a gap exists between educational technologists' conceptualizations of citizenship and the larger implications of citizenship within a democracy. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a between-study analysis of the literature to answer--How does the field of educational technology discuss and research digital citizenship? The data were coded using constant comparative analysis. The study adopted a theoretical framework grounded in Westheimer and Kahne's (2004) "What Kind of Citizen," and Krutka and Carpenter's (2016) digital approach to citizenship. Findings: The findings suggest that educational technologists' uncritical usage of the term digital citizenship limits the authors' field's ability to contribute to a fundamental purpose of public schooling in a democracy--to develop citizens. Further, it hampers imagining opportunities to use educational technology to develop pedagogies of engaged citizenship for social justice. Originality/value: Reframing the conception of digital citizenship as active civic engagement for social justice pushes scholarship, and its attendant implications for practice, in a proactive direction aimed at dismantling oppression.

AB  - The main objective of this collaborative study of a qualitative nature is to delve into the pedagogical keys of the educational project at "Antzuola Herri Eskola" (Antzuola Public School). This educational centre is a public nursery and primary school in the Basque Country with more than 40 years of innovative pedagogical experience in which the participation of students, the involvement of the educational community, as well as democratic values and well-being have become the hallmarks of the programme. In order to achieve the objective, a content analysis and information triangulation has been carried out through the participation of three focus groups composed of the key people in charge of the project and leaders of the innovation process. Moreover, the school's own teaching publications have also been analysed, after which all of the information was arranged into different categories. The information obtained and its subsequent analysis reveal the key strategies implemented by the team of professionals at the school in promoting an inclusive and democratic educational centre that fulfils the needs of its community and current society. Furthermore, the voices of the teachers themselves demonstrate how they have implemented these key strategies into their teaching practice, and the transformations they have had to make at the curricular, organisational, and attitudinal levels.

AB  - Educators, implicitly or explicitly, are interested in truth and, therefore, in argumentation. Argumentation is defined here as an evidence-based process by which one person may convince another of the rightness of his or her point of view. One of the primary uses of argumentation is within democratic deliberation writ large and within classrooms. As a teacher of an applied philosophy course, I was interested in exploring the concept of truth through the mechanism of argumentation. In this article I explore the degree to which the model of "rational argumentation" reflects what actually persuades people in their political lives. How important are underlying values in the political and other positions people take? Given that schools are one of the only spaces where ideological diversity can be encountered within a supportive environment, I argue that discussions about values is a vital ingredient toward democratic life.

AB  - For centuries, Macau's schooling has embraced laissez-faire market principles, a stasis that from AY2016/17 is being changed by the government offering schools tuition coupons conditional on their adoption of a common school curriculum. A study of part of this new common curriculum, the development of a music curriculum for junior secondary schools in Macau, addresses three research questions: (a) What are music teachers' perceptions and how do these frame the implementation of Macau's common music curriculum? (b) Do music teachers' expectations align with those of the central government? (c) Do music teachers perceive that they impact on or are impacted by this innovation? Discussion of the findings highlights a controversy about the role of teachers within curriculum development--should teachers be center staged (Lawton (2012 [1980]) or is this view an oversimplification based on false assumptions of a social democratic tradition (Whitty (1985, 2012 [1981])?

AB  - The global shift toward neoliberalism continues to impact early childhood in numerous ways. One example of this shift is the push by education stakeholders for the incorporation of technology into the teaching of young children. Advocates contend implementing such technology in the classroom will increase children's academic performance and provide them with the skills needed to attain well-paying jobs in the future. Such rhetoric creates a new set of challenges for early educators who seek to resist this neoliberal shift toward individualism and the framing of education as a process of learning, earning, and consuming. The case study examined in this article begins to address this issue by investigating how utilizing iPads in the process of becoming a teacher affected a sample of preservice teachers' articulations of their roles as educators. Investigating and analyzing their experiences provides members of the early childhood community with steps they might take to assist early educators in framing their roles as teachers through democratic conceptions of practice that they can then implement within their early education context.

AB  - As part of the general curricular ambitions of contributing to the development of a democratic society, Swedish schools are mandated to actively combat racism and extremism. This causes particular challenges when teachers encounter students who have been brought up in environments where racist and extremist worldviews dominate. This study analyses four Swedish neo-Nazi leaders' experiences of schooling and how they have utilised these experiences when establishing an approach for their children's schooling. The focal point of the analysis is the ideological dilemmas that arise from clashes of conviction among neo-Nazi leaders, their children and the teachers. The results show how neo-Nazi leaders use their own negative experiences of schooling to prepare their children on how to escape both democratic education and prevent social stigmatisation.

AB  - The objectives of this research included to study the effects of democratic parenting and teaching activities on global citizenship according to logical reasoning in making decisions on political attitudes among 2,286 students from 80 classrooms. The research instruments included 1) a set of rating-scale questionnaires for students with 92 items, having the reliability as 0.968 and 2) a set of rating-scale questionnaires for teachers with 23 items, having the reliability as 0.893. The results of the multilevel structural equation model analysis revealed that the factor of political attitudes was the most important in describing each student's global citizenship with the explanation of the variance with democratic parenting and the analysis of applying the reasons in students' decisions was as 68.50%. Teaching activities affected positively on global citizenship both directly and indirectly through statistically significant factors with and together explained the variance of the global citizenship of each student by 84.00%. These findings highlight the importance of developing and fostering political attitudes that affect students' global citizenship through parenting and teaching activities covering the development of relevant factors as discussed in the Discussion and Implementation Part.

AB  - Drawing upon the African concept of "ubuntu," this article examines the epistemic orientations toward individual-society relations that inform democratic citizenship and identity in South Africa. Findings from focus group interviews conducted with 50 Xhosa teachers from all seven primary and intermediate schools in a township outside Cape Town depict the cultural contours of democracy and how the teachers reaffirm and question the dominant Western-oriented democratic narrative. Through "ubuntu," defined as the virtue of being human premised upon respect, the Xhosa teachers interrupt the prevailing rights-and-responsibilities discourse to interpose a conception of democracy based on rights, responsibilities, and respect. Society and schools, in their view, fall short in educating young learners for democratic citizenship in South Africa; their insights offer ways for formal schooling to improve upon its democratic mission.

AB  - Twelve leading Social Foundations of Education (SFE) scholars describe their professional work in the field. The research question within this oral history study is: In what ways do SFE scholars express the importance of the Liberal Arts (LA) framework for the community of educational stakeholders in a democracy? The respondents explain the degree to which democratic teaching and learning--building voice, perspective, and point-of-view of the individual within community--supports growth in society and prepares classroom teachers to do such work. Moreover, they identify SFE as a significant field that leverages the LA framework of critique and deep thinking in teacher preparation coursework. The respondents note the importance of a strong relationship between SFE and Schools of Education (SOEs) methods faculty. They describe how SFE, with LA, advances democratic practices, essential to the work of SOE methods faculty, teachers of PreK-20+ classrooms, and the communities they serve.

AB  - This paper compares and contrasts pre-service teachers' (PSTs) beliefs about democracy in Argentina and Australia. While there are many important studies of how school students understand democracy and democratic participation, few have studied what teachers, and especially pre-service teachers, think about democracy. This paper uses a mixed methods approach to present quantitative and qualitative responses to the contrasting understandings of democracy from an established and a newly emerging democracy. Determining the linkage between education and democracy is important as it has implications for how our children will relate to democracy both in the classroom and in society as future citizens.

AB  - In a multicultural democratic society, the increasing demographic diversity within and across nation-states calls attention to pedagogical knowledge and skills needed to engage students in discussing controversial cultural issues (CCIs). Woven in the intersection of democratic education and multicultural education, this qualitative study sought to unravel the nature and process of teachers' decision-making for their instruction of CCIs by taking a closer look at the experiences of three South Korean elementary teachers. The findings highlight how the teachers' conceptions of certain cultural issues have changed over time with the nation's growing demographic diversity, how the shift in their perspectives has affected their professional judgement for the instruction of such issues, and how the teachers' cultural critical consciousness impacts their professional judgement.

AB  - Purpose: Canada is a country that has a democratized higher education system, based on solid principles of access, quality and accountability. Brazil, on the other hand, is a country that seeks to advance its higher education system. For this reason, this paper aims to understand with the main stakeholders of the systems, the perceptions in relation to higher education in terms of access, quality and accountability, confronting two educational systems, the Brazilian and the Canadian. Design/methodology/approach: The author applied an exploratory and qualitative method through categorical content analysis in a multicase study. Data were collected through 10 interviews with government managers, 18 unstructured (open) questionnaires, where 13 were applied to professors and experts in higher education and four to student leaders. Findings: The results demonstrate that, for Canadian participants, these principles should guide any nation, as it is something demanded by society itself: democratic access to the system, that the available system has quality and that the resources allocated to the system are being well applied. In addition, Brazilian participants understand that it is necessary to deepen this debate, including a new principle: permanence, as it is a country of traditional social inequality. Originality/value: This study presented the perceptions of an educational system based on the principles of access, quality and accountability, the Canadian system and the perspectives for a system that intends to develop in this context in Brazil.

AB  - In countries that embraced democracy after the fall of communism, education became a particular focus for policy change, particularly within their citizenship programmes. Schools that had been used to inculcate obedience to and unfailing support for authoritarian regimes were now being required to adopt citizenship programmes incorporating democratic values. This paper reports a study in Malawi that explored the school as a location where democratic citizenship is practiced. Using a multiple case study approach in three different kinds of secondary schools to explore students' participation in school affairs, the study found that different forms of participation were being encouraged, with each school apparently socialising students to distinctive kinds of citizenship roles. The paper highlights a conflict between democratic values and traditional roles of schools leading to new and hybrid school cultures. Providing scope for student voice to be heard can lead to tensions and paradoxical practices.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the principal's perceptions about, and strategies for, increasing students' active participation in the day-to-day affairs and decision-making at a secondary school located in a rural, mountainous region of Pakistan. By exploring the principal's leadership practices, this study aims to answer the question, 'how can school principals promote students' participation in school leadership and, in turn, how can such participation ultimately lead to a socially just and democratic community?' To us 'school leadership' is not a set of skills or positional authority that lies in one individual -- the principal -- but it is a practice which is widely distributed and engaged by a range of people including students in the day-to-day affairs and business of the school. Although, students' participation in curricular and co-curricular activities and decision-making processes in schools is widely studied elsewhere, there is hardly any study on this topic in the context of Pakistan, particularly with reference to rural schools. Therefore, an empirical investigation based on a qualitative case study method was conducted to collect data from the principal as well as from other members of the school community regarding the leadership practices that promote students' active participation in school affairs. The findings of the study reveal a number of interesting and contextually relevant strategies used by the principal as well as the gaps between his beliefs and practices and the challenges he faces in increasing students' participation in various activities and decisions at the school.

AB  - The demand for a significant advance in democracy that allows greater civic participation takes place in different countries and historical times. In Catalonia, the process toward self-determination shakes the social and political debate from 2010 to the present day, when the population feels that their rights are being curtailed and begins to show their discomfort with massive and peaceful demonstrations that influence the political forces. Since late 2017, the struggle for self-government has intensified and schools have been involved in this process in a twofold way: by serving as polling stations in the referendum held on October 1, 2017, which was not approved by the Spanish government, and by being accused of childhood indoctrination due to pupil involvement. As representatives of the school, principals need to take a sensible position in controversial issues, which is not easy when antagonistic values are at stake. The question the authors would like to approach here is how Catalan schools currently undertake child participation, according to the principal's point of view, in order to discern what actions would be necessary to encourage children's governance both in school and in society. This examination offers a comprehensive framework for encouraging children's participation in the co-creation and governance of the society in which they live--since the decisions that are taken today affect them fully--the results of the survey for principals serve as the basis for further debate on the right of children as a group--generally invisible--to participate in the governance of the school and its impact on the democratic quality of our societies.

AB  - This article is an inquiry into the work of educators at the James Baldwin School (JBS), a New York City public school with an explicit commitment to democracy in its mission and core values. The author was founding principal at JBS for the first six years, has stayed in touch, and recently went back to talk with faculty about how their work has evolved. JBS is only one of many in a long history of schools striving to ensure that the institutions charged with preparing youth for citizenship in a democracy function themselves in democratic ways. Past or present, and wherever they may be, in an era when elected officials across our country show authoritarian leanings, the work of schools that strive to function democratically demand careful consideration by educators, learners, and leaders in all corners.

AB  - In this article, we argue that democratic habits remain as vital for education and culture today as they were when Dewey published "Democracy and Education" in 1916. We take our point of departure from his treatment of habit and education in the book. Dewey dissolves the stereotypical notion that habits refer solely to mechanical, repetitive and mindless routines. He reconstructs the concept so that we can see why habits can be both stable and dynamic. They can evolve through action and reflection upon the consequences of action. We draw from his analysis a conception of democratic habits that educators today can cultivate across the curriculum and overall life of the school.

AB  - Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings is the former Kellner Family Distinguished Professor of Urban Education in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. She served as president of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) in 2005-2006. Dr. Ladson-Billings has contributed widely to the development of two fields of study, culturally relevant pedagogy and critical race theory as well as their impact on today's teachers, students, and classroom dynamics. Within her numerous publications, her passion for children who are disadvantaged in public schools is evident. Dr. Ladson-Billings developed the theory Education Debt to depict the historical significance of inequality and its pervasiveness within our culture and educational institutions. This article presents a conversational interview with Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings that was conducted on February 20, 2021. In this interview, Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings discusses: (1) who mentored her or inspired her; (2) her thoughts about how the dual pandemics (COVID-19 and structural racism) are impacting teacher education; (3) her ideas about how teacher educators might help teachers encountering stressful circumstances; (4) her thoughts on educating new teachers and what might be needed to further galvanize those interested in public education, and the role it plays in our democracy, to take action; and (5) what she envisions for herself during retirement.

AB  - In this article, I examine how forms of new media, or social and digital media (SDM), can serve as conduits of participatory democracy while, at the same time, perpetuate the cannibalization of a cornerstone of democracy: public schools. I discuss how this new era of unprecedented access to content creation and dissemination has opened spaces and opportunities to spread misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation (MDM) about public schooling. I trace how forms of SDM are being used to perpetuate the anti-CRT movement, foster attacks on LGBTQ+ students, and exacerbate the villainizing and doxing of educators and leaders in public schools. I then discuss the role of critical media literacy in a democracy to combat these movements, and offer suggestions and provocations to address these cannibalistic campaigns against public schools.

AB  - Over the last decades, many European Union countries have invested in strengthening participatory learning in citizenship education policy and practice. This survey study provides insight into how high school teachers in the Netherlands advance critical democratic citizenship and a democratic school culture in the context of mock elections. A quarter of the schools that organized mock elections in 2017 participated in the study. Analysis reveals that attention for critical, value-related teacher aims and teacher aims directed at strengthening a democratic school culture is still limited in mock election-related education. It also shows that half of the participating schools offer less than one hour of mock election-related educational activities, and that one-third of the teachers would like to offer additional educational activities.

AB  - Visual arts provisions are central to children's holistic, play-based learning, yet the visual arts self-efficacy beliefs and subject content knowledge of early childhood educators influence pedagogical choices. When early childhood educators lack the visual arts confidence, skills, and knowledge required to effectively support children's visual arts learning and engagement, children's learning in the visual arts domain may be restricted; resulting in a negative cycle of influence whereby the next generation are denied their right to access visual languages. Qualitative case study research explored the visual arts beliefs and pedagogy of 12 degree qualified and vocationally trained early childhood educators. The conceptual framework, designed to to interpret and analyse the research data, aligns Dewey's philosophies of democracy, education and art with the philosophy and visual arts praxis of the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. The research findings suggest educator's low visual arts self-efficacy beliefs develop during childhood and are not improved by pre-service training, resulting in limited visual arts skills and knowledge. The research participants' visual arts pedagogy appeared to be strongly influenced by the experiential 'baggage' they carried into their pre-service training and practice contexts, by the participants' theoretical beliefs about children's development and by a range of divergent beliefs about the purposes of visual art in the early childhood context. Although training has the potential to broadly inform knowledge and practice, this study suggests that unless limiting visual arts self-efficacy beliefs are disrupted by constructivist theoretical knowledge and combined with practical skills and knowledge, the visual arts curriculum offered to children may be significantly compromised.

AB  - The aim of this article is to examine the ways in which curriculum goals on digitalisation are viewed in relation to the overarching democratic mission of Swedish preschools. Groups of preschool staff from three preschools located in different areas were interviewed with the focus on how they discuss democracy and the democratic aspects of "digital tools" and children's "digital competence," which are concepts used in the curriculum. Collective mind maps -- constructed by the participants -- were used as focal points in the interviews. The analysis centres on the content of these discussions, but also touches on the ways in which the groups communicated. The findings show that the groups from the three preschools expressed very different views on using digital tools and developing preschoolers' digital competence, and that these views corresponded with their general views on democracy. The ways in which the groups expressed their views of democracy are also reflected in their discussions with each other. Preschool teachers' and childcare workers' own lack of digital competence is mentioned briefly as a reason for not using digital devices by the group using them the least, but this does not seem to be the main reason for their infrequent use of digital media with the children.

AB  - The purpose of this essay is to revisit the notion of indoctrination in education by providing a summary of the field and highlighting the role of affects and emotions in the aftermath of the 'affective turn'. It is argued that "affective indoctrination"--defined as the emotional coercion or manipulation that, arguably, any form of education might use in order to be effective--is likely to invoke harm in students, intentionally or unintentionally. Hence, it is suggested that education theorists and educators in general need not only to acknowledge affective indoctrination as a possible component of all education, but also to explore and take measures how to minimize the extent to which indoctrinal teaching may be facilitated through cultivating certain affects and emotions. Theorizing affective indoctrination can offer new insights into how and why educators and students adopt or resist particular political beliefs (e.g. democracy or fascism).

AB  - In "Democracy and Education," John Dewey argued that teachers should have control over their own work. He was, though, not only concerned about workplace democracy for teachers. He also argued against the philosophical underpinnings of educational policies that reproduced social hierarchies in the workplace. The main arguments of Dewey's book support teachers' autonomy and students' equality. When these arguments are read in light of what he wrote about democracy in many other works, they appear to be arguments for workplace democracy. These arguments raise questions about school management that are highly relevant today when prevalent views favor a culture of control.

AB  - Generation Z, known as millennial children, includes those born from 1995 to 2010, the period when the Internet and social networks became widely used, global communication increased, tolerance was given to different cultural elements, and there was flexibility. The aim of the present research was to establish the leadership expectations of teachers belonging to Generation Z working in educational organizations in the context of school principals. In this context, focus group interviews consisting of semi structured questions were conducted with thirteen teachers from Generation Z currently working in public schools in our research conducted with a phenomenological design. Considering the findings, the leadership expectations of the Generation Z teachers in the behavior sub-theme of inclusivity involved sincerity, flexibility, warm communication, horizontal relationship, consistent behavior, supportive behavior, motivating, problem solving, and smiling. In the sub-theme of competencies, they focused on innovations, communication skills, technological competence, mentoring, competence in the field, being solution-oriented, being a researcher, taking initiative, financial management skills, and entrepreneurship competencies. In the values sub-theme, they included being fair and compassionate, altruistic attitude, respect for differences, sensitivity, patience, empathy, and openness to criticism. In the sub-theme of characteristics, they focus on being charismatic and democratic, openness to innovations and teamwork, analytical skills, project orientation, and determination.

AB  - Purpose: This paper proposes a new conception of school systems arising out of the collision of three forces--(1) a longstanding press to rationalize the technical work of schools in the service of educational excellence; (2) a growing democratic press to equitably engage community members in the process of defining educational excellence; which together are (3) heightening legacy uncertainties that pervade educational organizations. It then draws on paradox theory to explore how leaders might navigate the growing uncertainties that are central to the work of organizing for excellence and equity. Design/methodology/approach: Integrating scholarship related to organizational institutionalism, paradox theory, learning sciences, social justice leadership and educational system building, this paper examines the changing organization of schools, the growing uncertainty facing educators and the implications for leaders and preparation programs. Findings: This paper introduces two perspectives on how to navigate the growing uncertainty facing educators and educational leaders--one that centers on mitigating uncertainty, the other that prioritizes leveraging uncertainty. Both perspectives have affordances and limitations when considering the twin goals of educational excellence and equitable involvement in decision-making, and leaders should thus view uncertainty as a paradox--an interdependent, persistent, contradiction--that can never be fully resolved, but can be managed. A paradox perspective makes visible the complex work of effectively moving between mitigating and leveraging uncertainty, especially in a field where the latter garners more support and legitimacy. Originality/value: This paper synthesizes recent educational and organizational scholarship to develop a new conception of educational organizations and a corresponding approach to educational leadership capable of navigating the growing complexity and uncertainty that pervades school systems.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine democracy perception of classroom teachers via metaphor analysis. Study group for research is formed of 253 classroom teachers. "Democracy Metaphors Questionnaire" (DMQ) has been used in collecting data. Content analysis has been used on analysis of qualitative data of research and descriptive statistics have been used on quantitative data. The metaphors that teachers developed with a total 122 metaphors different from one another about democracy are gathered under "Indispensability," "Equality," "Social Order," "Freedom," "Endeavour," "Power," "Variety," "Progression," "Conservation," "Personal Gains," and "Nothingness." While the first three themes under which women teachers gathered being indispensability, equality, and endeavour metaphors, men teachers are gathered under indispensability, social order, and freedom metaphors. Family environment and upbringing, relations with friends, culture of social environment, political activities in society, and news in media tools have been the effective factors in forming democracy perception that the teachers possess.

AB  - Background/Context: Recent accounts of learning from experience in education tend to impoverish development and temporal processes as constructive categories for thinking about freedom and action. Drawing on Jacques Rancière's critique of development, Gert Biesta's 2010 article, "How to Exist Politically and Learn from It: Hannah Arendt and the Problem of Democratic Education," makes the case for a mode of democratic education that excludes the concept of development. In doing so, Biesta interprets Hannah Arendt's work as both problematic and constructive for democratic education. Purpose: This article challenges Biesta's reading of Arendt's concept of natality and development by focusing on what she calls the "double aspect of the child." It questions Biesta's deconstruction of development and attempts to show that natality and development cannot be that easily separated, especially if we are to maintain Arendt's radical account of freedom. The purpose of the research is to reclaim Arendt's "temporal framing" of childhood and adulthood, and to argue that development, while not unproblematic in traditional psychological accounts, is in fact a necessary condition of her concept of natality--what she calls the essence of education. Research Design: The argument in this article is developed through a critical interpretation and discussion of the works of Gert Biesta and Hannah Arendt, with a specific focus on their ideas about action and new beginnings, and the role of development for an adequate understanding of natality in education. Conclusions/Recommendations: In making my case for a more radical reading of natality in education than Biesta offers, I present an alternative, with the aid of David Archard's work, to the standard normative account of the developmental model that Biesta attributes to Arendt when he describes her account of the "child"-"adult" relation as "too psychological." I then appeal to Arendt's understanding of temporality in her essay "Between Past and Future," in which she names the "gap" in time as the juncture where freedom can occur. I attempt to show that this gap mirrors our actual human birth and our reception into a language community, in such a way that suggests how freedom and action entail a kind of "unready readiness" that is not unique to newborns. However, unlike Biesta, who acknowledges as much with respect to our insertion into the human world, I maintain that this temporal gap in time is a constitutive feature of development and, as such, of "natality." I conclude by arguing that development and becoming are important concepts that should not be left solely to the discipline of psychology if we are to reduce the likelihood of developmental"ism" in education.

AB  - The need for school principals to implement teacher-supportive leadership practices is paramount to students' learning. The present study synthesized the disparate fields of educational leadership and educational psychology in an effort to investigate the effects of principal leadership styles on teacher motivation. Specifically, the effects of the principal leadership styles of authoritarian, democratic, or laissez-faire practices on teachers' motivation were investigated from the theoretical framework of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Results from a survey indicated that principals' leadership styles were significantly related to the combined dependent variables of teacher autonomy, relatedness, competence, and social isolation. Specifically, the results of post hoc tests indicated that teachers reported higher levels of autonomy, relatedness, and competence under a principal who was perceived to demonstrate a democratic leadership style. Moreover, administrators who were interviewed shared ways in which they supported teachers' autonomy, relatedness, and competence in addition to other motivational strategies.

AB  - Women's representation in leadership positions is still low because there is still an opinion that women are not worthy of being leaders and only men are worthy of being leaders. This condition proves women's low participation in leadership roles because the patriarchal culture still strongly influences people's perspective. This paper aims to describe the roles and positions of women in school management. The research data are in the form of observations and interviews with female school principals and four male vice principals. The qualitative method with a gender perspective is used to identify women's leadership style in Elementary School 002, Muara Badak District. The results showed that the principal in Muara Badak District prefers masculine characters and maintains a feminine character. It has an impact on assertiveness in controlling the school management process. Second, in carrying out school management functions, the principal's leadership style applies a democratic leadership style. As a leader, participation seeks to provide trust and establish good communication by prioritising teamwork in decision-making.

AB  - The aim of the article is to deepen the knowledge of progressivism and how it was manifested in practice in Swedish secondary schools from a teacher perspective before it was prescribed in policy during the reforms of the 1950s. In the current educational debate, progressivism is blamed by some for being the root of a permissive style of education in decline that no longer provides any knowledge to students, and regarded by others as the starting point for the modern form of democratic schooling. The question we pursue is in what way progressive teaching practice existed before policy. We do that by investigating teacher narratives describing their own teaching practices found in a historical archive from 1946. Hence, rather than looking at the policy level as in most studies, we are unpacking the black box of progressive teaching. Through thematic analysis, we investigate 209 secondary teacher narratives from teachers of History, Biology and Mother tongue. We found that the theme of student participation was very frequently reported in 76% of the accounts, while student interaction (33%) and extended classroom (37%) were somewhat less reported. Hence, our study shows that progressive teaching existed in different ways before it appeared in policy.

AB  - Political simulations are considered promising tools to instigate democratic learning in schools. This article reports a qualitative inquiry into student involvement in the organization of the 2012 mock elections--the shadow elections that schools can organize in conjunction with the official elections-- in eight high schools in the Netherlands. The objective of this inquiry is twofold: to evaluate student involvement in mock elections in these schools and to lay the theoretical groundwork for further quantitative inquiries into student participation in political events. For the deductive analysis of student roles in organizing the mock election, I adapted Fielding and Moss's (2012) "patterns of partnership" typology using a critical democratic citizenship education lens. The analysis of interviews with teachers suggests that students were rarely envisioned as sources of data or as active respondents; they were not invited to deviate from existing planning protocols; and student-staff collaboration was not framed as a political project in its own right. Based on the empirical findings and the typology constructed for this study, I conclude with several recommendations for furthering meaningful student participation in mock elections and related events and for improving the quality of political spaces in schools.

AB  - Problem Statement: Dressing for school has been intensely disputed and has led to periodic changes in dress codes since the foundation of the Turkish republic. Practitioners have tried to put some new practices related to school dress codes into practice for redressing former dress code issues involving mandatory dress standards for both students and teachers but which caused chaos and confusion in schools because of lack of legal regulation. Uncertainty in dress codes, of which implications and outcomes are still being discussed in terms of psychological, socioeconomic, and academic, causes issues for teachers, students, and parents and can negatively affect performance. Purpose of Study: The present study is focused on the perceptions of school leaders, teachers, and students in terms of dress codes as an educational policy. Education deeply affects every individual in society; from this point of view any individual in society needs to be involved in new policies in the field of education. For this purpose, this study addressed perceptions of school leaders, teachers, students, and parents in terms of free dress codes in schools. The study also aimed to contribute solutions to the dress code problem. Method: This is a survey method study. The study sample was comprised of 611 participants (100 managers, 111 teachers, 254 students, and 146 parents). Data were collected via a 30-item questionnaire that was developed by a researcher. Frequency, arithmetic mean, independent groups, and one-way variance (ANOVA) techniques were used to analyze data. A Tukey HSD test was used to determine in which groups the sample differed. Significance was set at p <0.05. Findings and Results: While managers (4, 80-47, 70) and teachers (4, 19-3, and 90) perceived the highest ratio for several parameters: 1) "dresses are perceived as sign of students' socioeconomic level" and 2) "students pattern themselves after other friends". Parents (3, 52) and students (3, 69) perceived the highest ratio in terms of "Students easily and comfortably act." These findings indicate that parents and students have similar opinions. The results do not indicate significant differences among perception of shareholders, managers, teachers, students, and parents about dressing in schools. Conclusion and Recommendations: All new practices should consider every individual in society. Parents, teachers, and managers need to be informed about the effects of dress on students' physiological and psychological development. Legal regulations must be put into practice to let students wear different clothes and have a sense of pluralistic democracy.

AB  - This correlation study investigates the relationships between prospective teachers' multicultural education attitudes and classroom management styles. The participants were 495 prospective teachers majoring in different departments of education faculties at two state universities in Turkey. "Democracy and Multicultural Education Attitude Scale" and "Classroom Management Style Scale" were used as data collection tools. Correlation and regression analyses were performed for data analysis by using SPSS 23.0 software. The results of descriptive analyses showed that most of the participants adopted authoritative style in terms of classroom management. Also, they had positive attitudes towards multicultural and democracy education. According to correlation analysis, there were significant relationships between the variables. Specifically, authoritative style was a powerful predictor of the attitude towards democracy and multicultural education. The prospective teachers with more authoritarian and indifferent styles had more biases towards multicultural education. Moreover, it is estimated that discussion and educational implications will shed light on teacher education.

AB  - Goffman's theory of total institutions and Fanon's theory of violence were used to explain student protests and violence in Kenyan secondary schools. Youth violence around the world is not a new phenomenon. However, the persistence, frequency, and intensity of violence, and their consequences beg for logical explanations and remedies. This study was part of a three-year project facilitated through the Networked Improvement Community partnership for self-study and intervention. Although a holistic approach to research was applied, data for this study were gathered through narrative inquiry. Participants (teachers, principals, and members of the school community) were identified purposively using the snowball process. Data were analyzed through deductive and inductive reasoning. Findings indicate a preponderance of student protest and violence among students in boarding schools. Student violence was a response to the devaluing and oppressive environment in boarding schools which resembled total institutions, and students exercising democratic rights to protest. The paper argues that school authorities could mitigate violent protests by providing formal political means of representation and democratic decision-making; creating new spaces for negotiation and peaceful protest; listening to the voices of students; and engaging in dialogue to create a common vision and mission.

AB  - Mathematics results in South Africa are of serious concern. The reports by TIMSS [Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study] prove that the teaching of mathematics remains a challenge in the South African schooling system. In their attempts to improve mathematics results and to cope with the many curriculum changes since the start of democracy in 1994, mathematics teachers are experiencing increased levels of stress and anxiety. Diversity is a critical issue in education and learners suffer the consequences if teachers do not recognise the importance of diversity. Democracy leads to curriculum change and causes socio-cultural diversity among the learners in a classroom. Mathematics teachers faced ousting of their power in the classroom through the learner-centred strategies that they were expected to implement. In this study, three semi-structured interviews and a focus group discussion were deployed to generate data. The dualistic theoretical lenses used in this paper are based on the theory of culturally responsive teaching and theory of cultural capital. The findings that emerged from the data show that mathematics teachers are ill-equipped to meet the needs of the socio-culturally diverse learners in their differing classrooms. Further research in exploring ethnomathematics as a culturally responsive teaching strategy will reveal new dynamics in socio-cultural deficit thinking.

AB  - Growing polarization in European societies has changed not only political landscapes but also public debates about the past, which has, in turn, had an impact on the way history is taught and talked about in schools. This article explores how these trends are experienced by history educators across Europe and asks which issues history educators perceive to be controversial and sensitive and how they approach the prejudices they frequently encounter when addressing controversial and sensitive issues. Based on focus group discussions with 33 participants from 25 European countries, the article identifies three different forms of prejudice and describes how the focus group participants tried to undermine nationalism, counter xenophobia and fight anti-Semitism. Interpreted from a practice theory perspective, the examples shared by the focus group participants indicate that teaching strategies from the disciplinary approach "toolbox" can help to undermine nationalist stereotypical thinking if they are fine-tuned to the interests and emotions of the learning group and that history teaching routines shaped by the disciplinary approach need to be interrupted on occasion in order to reflect on and deconstruct xenophobic or anti-Semitic prejudice. Overall, the article argues that history teachers need to be aware of the affective dimension of historical learning, including underlying or open prejudices held by students, in order to support the teaching of democratic education goals such as respect and openness to cultural otherness.

AB  - Recent controversies concerning freedom of expression on university campuses have raised the question of how the limits of free speech can be determined in a justified way in a pluralistic public space such as the campus. The article addresses this question from the viewpoint of two complementary theoretical perspectives: Rainer Forst's respect conception of toleration, and the discourse theory of democracy developed by Jürgen Habermas and Seyla Benhabib. These theories are argued to provide a non-arbitrary, impartial and procedural model for determining the limits of free speech on campus. Deriving primarily from the discourse model, the article suggests that the limits of freedom of expression on campus should be determined by collective deliberative processes involving the affected students. Moreover, it is argued that, instead of prohibiting controversial topics or views, the university administration and teachers should focus on establishing procedural rules of rational deliberation. This is argued to increase students' understanding of the nature of legitimate democratic discussion and thus accomplish the university's educational task of fostering students' ability to use their freedom of speech in a responsible way.

AB  - Using a mixed methods design, the researchers investigated understandings and practices of democracy across Round Square, a worldwide network of 180 schools committed to shared values. An extensive questionnaire received 4020 student and 863 teacher returns; additionally, leaders, students, and parents from five case study schools on different continents were interviewed. All stakeholder groups were found to value democracy highly, but saw its implementation in their schools as challenging and limited. While staff and parents espoused more holistic understandings of democratic practices and cultures, students focused primarily on systems of election and representation. A philosophically informed framework for developing 'responsible leadership', and a values-led approach to school improvement, are offered to deepen students' democratic agency through informed, active, and reflective engagement with people, situations, and curricula.

AB  - The concentration of this study was the documentation and analysis of ways in which competing conceptions of citizenship play out in actual classroom settings. Examining three cases in the context of the Israeli education system, its findings show that civics teachers' views and beliefs influenced ways in which they interpreted the curriculum standards and reacted to schools policies and atmosphere, even in cases where these views contradicted. Nevertheless, when confronted with competing conceptions of citizenship as presented by their students, the teachers were less willing to open true democratic conversations, resulting in lessons that did not necessarily create a true democratic atmosphere.

AB  - In this essay, Sarah Stitzlein describes the democratic potential of parents choosing to opt out of school testing, explaining how they ought to engage in political dissent to best fulfill their responsibilities as citizens and to practice democracy on behalf of children and schools. Parents' decisions to opt out are often based on rights claims about their oversight as parents; moral claims regarding the potential undue pressure testing places on children and the misuse of students' scores; political and economic concerns with the role of corporations in testing; and educational claims about the validity of scores, the narrowing of curriculum, and the deprofessionalization of teachers who feel they must teach to the test. By building publics around these rationales and shared concerns, parents may increase the political legitimacy of public schools and create public schools that are more deeply public; in some cases, they may also provide an educational model of democratic life for budding citizens in schools to observe and learn from.

AB  - Background: Teacher education, including physical education teacher education (PETE), around the world remains highly autocratic and content focused [Apple, M. W. 2000. "Official Knowledge: Democratic Education in a Conservative Age." New York: Routledge]. Scholars in physical education [O'Sullivan, M., D. Siedentop, and L. F. Locke. 1992. "Toward Collegiality: Competing Viewpoints among Teacher Educators." Quest 44 (2): 266-280] as well as in and education more broadly [McAllister, G., and J. J. Irvine. 2000. "Cross Cultural Competency and Multicultural Teacher Education." "Review of Educational Research" 70 (1): 3-24] have noted the limited opportunities for the discussion of democratic practices, critical pedagogy, and citizenship education. However, since the fall of the military dictatorship, Brazil has had the opportunity to reconstruct teacher education with a focus on democracy. Many of these changes have been influenced by the philosophy of Paulo Freire [1970. "Pedagogy of the Oppressed". New York: Continuum; 1985. "The Politics of Education". Westport, CT: Bergin & Garvey; 1998a. "Pedagogy of Freedom: Ethics, Democracy and Civic Courage". Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield; 1998b. "Teachers as Cultural Workers: Letters to Those Who Dare to Teach". Boulder, CO: Westview] whose conceptualization of democracy embraces an interactional perspective. Through the eyes of Gylton, a PETE student, this study depicts new possibilities for democratization in PETE. Participants: Gylton, the first author of the article, was the primary participant and Maria served as an informant. The setting of the study was "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais" (UFMG), a large university in Brazil where Gylton was a student and Maria was a faculty member. Method: A qualitative design structured around the tenants of existential phenomenology was adopted. Gylton and Maria were participated in two semistructured interviews [Patton, M. Q. 2002. "Qualitative Research and Evaluation Methods". Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage] and follow-up telephone interviews and email correspondence. Findings: The data analysis revealed that Gylton's experiences during childhood had a profound impact on his initial appraisals of the purpose of democratic practices in PETE. During his time at UFMG, Gylton experienced a shift in his consciousness and came to realize the importance of democratic practices in PETE. Gylton engaged in transformative action at the micro- and macro-levels through his exposure to democratic practices. Interactions with Maria led Gylton to resist the authoritarian system of education and reconceptualize the role of physical education.

AB  - In a historical review of curriculum revisions carried out in British Columbia, Canada, the author argued that these revisions were undemocratic in the sense that the revisions were carried out by a small selection of individuals associated with the Ministry/Department of Education. This article begins with a brief review of previous findings along with a discussion of how democracy, and in particular, procedural democracy, are understood. Procedural democracy is argued to relate to the public's knowledge about government-initiated changes, ability to provide feedback, and how this feedback is attended to by those in government. This article then discusses the research methods and findings of a study carried out with British Columbian teachers and curriculum developers at a time when a major curriculum revision is occurring. The survey was designed based on the theoretical model of procedural model of democracy described. The findings focus on looking at the perceptions of teachers and curriculum developers regarding the process of curriculum reform carried out in British Columbia.

AB  - The aim of this scoping review is to investigate the language policy's ideological basis which mandates the learning of English as a foreign language in secondary schools all over the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It also aims to reveal the current state of affairs with regard to English as a foreign language in the Congolese curriculum. Using the approach proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005), several published articles, books, journals and dissertations were consulted for our scoping review. Spanning a period between 1960 to 2020, the main focus was on educational language planning and policies in the DRC. After analyzing the selected publications, the results indicated that until today there is no language institution to regulate linguistic practices and teaching. The DRC's state-owned schools still use the old national curriculum, which was left by the Belgian colonizers with some modifications. Foreign language teacher education and production of academic materials need to be integrated in the budget planning and implementation processes to accompany the policy regarding the teaching of English language at secondary schools. There is also an expressed need for a language institution engaged in research and training of different languages such as French, English and recognized national languages.

AB  - With a pandemic, a war, structural racism, and the fragility of democracy crowding the headlines, Michael R. Koval has have been reexamining his role as professor and the objectives, procedures, and assessment mechanisms of his classroom activities and assignments. For reasons described in the article, the assignments that resonate with him today, particularly in upper-level business law courses, focus on collaboration and engagement, comprehension and synthesis of voluminous and sometimes ambiguous information from relevant sources and materials, and writing practice. In this article, he examines how Legal Environment and Business Law professors long ago embraced the idea of active learning in the classrooms. The academy literature is replete with creative and inventive activities and assignments designed to teach, engage, entertain, and challenge their students. He explores the pedagogical underpinnings and explanations surrounding the development and implementation of these types of assignments, including the benefits of student collaboration and techniques that can be used to encourage it, the use of internet sources and other "outside" materials in promoting critical thinking, and the benefits of using writing assignments to reinforce learning and prepare business students for the workplace.

AB  - People who engage in the life of a school is in a unique position to isolate and push back against the growing white nationalist movement and the hateful narratives it touts. Their job is to build schools where everyone feels valued and where our students can grow to be engaged citizens of an inclusive democracy. This sidebar article is adapted from "Confronting White Nationalism in Schools: A Toolkit." Through five scenarios--from a student secretly carving a swastika on a desk to openly advocating for a white pride student group- the toolkit offers practical advice for the whole school community. It also shares symbols of white nationalism to aid recognition and explains the misguided thinking inherent in five common defenses of white nationalism. The toolkit works best as a guide with suggestions and resources to help school communities navigate their own questions and challenges. Students, teachers, staff, administrators, parents, and other community entities can collaborate to adapt these approaches and find new solutions. In this article, the authors focus on high schools, but many of these resources also apply to middle schools and colleges.

AB  - Global migration, global markets, and technological advances have connected the world at an unprecedented scale and have diversified the communities with which people engage and the schools in which educators teach. This study explores the school leadership attributes that facilitate the learning of critical competencies needed to thrive in a diverse, interconnected world. Using a grounded theory approach to analyze in-depth interviews with eleven practicing school principals, ten globally minded leadership practices emerged from the data. These fell under the constructs of setting the direction, developing people, redesigning the organization, and situating glocally. Findings hold implications for how educational leadership programs and professional development providers can utilize this emerging framework to\ cultivate globally minded leaders.

AB  - This research shows the development and influencing factors of high school English teachers' evaluation of professional learning community in Changchun, China. Followed Olivier and Hipp & Huffma's research, the teacher professional learning community evaluation questionnaire was developed by the researchers. 422 English teachers in Changchun were invited to participate in the online survey. This study found that the organization characteristics of professional learning communities in this city shared similar characteristics with Western countries at some degree. English perceptions of including the "shared personal practice" and "collective learning and application" achieves the average level in this research. Compared to the western professional learning communities, the Chinese professional learning communities in this study lack of the democratic leadership and shared value and vision attributions. According to the analysis, we find that the Confucian cultural context, teacher' career development stages, the pressures of national college entrance examination and the systematic teaching training have a significant impact on the evaluation of teacher professional learning communities. Aiming at to build a learning organisation rather than a bureaucratic administration, we suggest that the "shared value and vison" and "shared and supportive leadership" needs more reform in the current professional learning communities. Namely, traditional Soviet model of school-based professional learning communities need to reform toward a learning organisation emphasizing the teaching and learning.

AB  - Studies show that adolescents who follow a higher educational track have more positive experiences than those of lower levels with aspects of democracy, such as decision-making or discussions. This study focuses on how adolescents from different educational tracks evaluate the various possibilities to experience democracy in daily life, and whether school is compensating for any difference therein. Data were gathered by interviewing 40 adolescents at two points in time (eighth and tenth grade). The results suggest that, especially in the later phase of secondary education, according to the experiences of adolescents it is apparent that school exacerbates instead of decreases social differences in society. Those in the higher educational track more often than those in the lower track experience having discussions and being encouraged to be socially and politically engaged. Opportunities for teachers and for citizenship education to strengthen democratic socialisation on both educational tracks are discussed.

AB  - The modern university has been called, "a series of separate schools and departments held together by a central heating system," and, in a play on this line, "a series of individual faculty entrepreneurs held together by a common grievance over parking." Whether parking, heating, or, more probable today, WiFi, these tongue-in-cheek caricatures belie a more serious worry that higher education is rudderless, lacking a unifying "raison d'etre". Across the U.S., pockets of politicians view higher education in economic terms, seeking to peg public funding to the size of post-graduation salaries or other criteria ostensibly focused on outcomes more than inputs. Professors and administrators, at times at odds with this perspective on higher education, see cultivating critical thinking as college's central purpose. Meanwhile, student feedback demonstrates the vital role relationships play in university life. These and other visions of higher education may initially appear to conflict; yet, we argue that they often operate in concert to serve higher education's broader public purpose--that of supporting our national democracy.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the opinions of pre-service classroom teachers about academic controversy, from the cooperative learning methods, implemented in social studies teaching course. Using the action research pattern from the qualitative research approaches, the study group for the research comprised 42 preservice teachers in third year attending the primary education department in a state university. Research data were collected from preservice teachers with an interview form asking open-ended questions Responses of preservice teachers to the questions included opinions about the positive and negative aspects of the academic controversy method; whether they would apply this method in future classes and why; and about the contribution of the method to social and individual development of students. Opinions of preservice teachers after implementing the method in the class environment were that the academic controversy method was fun and beneficial for peer teaching; increased in-class interaction, retention of knowledge and self-confidence; ensured effective participation in class, active learning and conflict management; provided democracy education, directed research, taught respect for differences, provided a multidimensional perspective, and reduced the need for authority; and that it developed self-control, self-expression, decision-making and problem-solving skills. Additionally, criticisms mentioned by preservice teachers included causing noise in the classroom, not being appropriate for all class levels, lessons or topics, being difficult to implement in crowded classrooms and that the duration was not sufficient for the implementation.

AB  - Citizenship education played a crucial role in the 19th century transition from royal sovereignty to democracy in the Nordic region, with folk high schools (FHS) playing an important role. While established to empower the people ("folk") for active participation in society, the contemporary folk high schools have reoriented from their initial national focus to emphasise global citizenship education. The paper traces this development and asks how the identity and practice of the FHS reflect the ideals of human rights education. The article outlines the ideology and history of the Nordic folk high schools and builds an analytical framework for two empirical studies of student texts. The final discussion applies the presented material to shed light on the research question and concludes by suggesting that the Nordic folk high schools can be seen as a regional adaption of human rights education.

AB  - Guided by Dewey's [1966. "Democracy and education." New York: The Free Press] concept of 'education as growth', the purpose of this paper is to explore learners' enactments of student voice in Physical Education (PE) at a time of curricular reform. A qualitative comparative case study design gathered data from 18 students across 10 months in a triad of Irish secondary schools using focus group interviews. Data were gathered and coded to identify emergent themes. Five experiential themes emerged: puppeteering; early enlightenment; enjoyment in living; equitable inquiry and critique; and learning to grow. Findings demonstrate how student voice encounters were necessary to enhance students' democratic experience of PE but the extent to which student voice was enacted to improve learning and assessment of curriculum was problematic for students to assert. Implementing student voice cannot be perceived and implemented as a fixed process but rather a fluid continuum of practice allowing more transformative experiences follow.

AB  - Since the 1990s, public schooling in Australia has been shaped by quasi-marketization that has incentivized competition between schools and installed a business logic to school governance. In this paper we argue that it is timely to consider how teachers and school leaders are understanding and responding to the affordances and challenges of this new "work order". We define this new work order as the languages and practices that are shaping public schooling, particularly in regards to increasing commercialization caused by (and contributing to) the quasi-marketization of schooling. The data gathered for this paper comes from a survey of public school educators who were members of the Australian Education Union (AEU). Our interest is in the perceptions that public school educators had of commercialization in their school system. We show that while many teachers express concerns with the logic behind much education policy, they are far from accepting the new work order. In fact, there was a strong sense of an ethical clash between the managerial nature of much policy and bureaucracy, and strongly held beliefs that public education is justified as a democratic good.

AB  - School principals are street-level bureaucrats whose sense-making about language policies makes them de-facto policy makers. In turn, their language policy-making is mediated by their language ideologies and contexts. Using a case study methodological framework, this article explores the language ideologies of 11 New York City elementary school principals with high numbers of Emergent Bilinguals. It attempts to answer Ruiz' call to make language ideologies clear and obvious in order to provide the level of transparency needed to enlighten the process of language policy creation and practice (Ruiz 1984). Analyses of the participating principals' narratives revealed the existence of three different language ideologies: Resource Instrumental Mobility (RIM), Resource Integrative Democratic (RID), and Language as a Problem (LAP). This paper is an exploration of the RIM and RID language ideologies, which consider language as a resource, but do so for intrinsically different reasons. Thus, the findings expand on Ruiz' (1984) "Orientations in Language Planning" by complicating and providing nuance to the concept of "Language-as-Resource."

AB  - The core purpose of the research was to explore the relationship between leadership styles of the principals' and teachers' job satisfaction. A sample of two hundred teachers (100 male and 100 female) was selected randomly from Public Secondary Schools of Lahore. A Questionnaire was developed to collect the data from the research respondents. The questionnaire was consisted of three sections. The first part of the questionnaire was consisted of demographic variables. The second part was related to the ten statements of principals' leadership styles (Autocratic and Democratic) and last part contained the fifteen statements regarding the job satisfaction of teachers. The researchers visited the secondary schools and took permission from principals for data collection from teachers. Mean, SD, Pearson product moment for correlation and independent sample t-test were applied to analyze the data. The major findings of the study indicated that mostly principals decide the operational objectives and standards of the school by themselves. It is also revealed from the study that most of principals use democratic leadership style because they take suggestions from teachers, cooperate and support with them in any matter. Findings of the study also proved that there is a significant relationship between democratic leadership style and job satisfaction of teachers. The school principals should enhance the participation of faculty in decision making.

AB  - Background/Context: The traditional stance on teacher political disclosure within K-12 education is that neutrality is the only morally appropriate approach for teachers to take when broaching political or social issues in their classes due to their role as state employees who serve a particular community. A number of recent high-profile cases of teachers intolerantly disclosing their political beliefs in their classrooms have only served to reinforce the belief among the general public that teachers too often use their positions of authority to proselytize to their students. However, both theoretical arguments made by scholars and empirical data from K-12 classrooms suggest that disclosure may be beneficial to students' learning experiences and civic development. Purpose: This article seeks to better understand the benefits and limitations of teacher political disclosure by framing disclosure around Foucault's conceptualization of parrhesia, which can loosely be defined as the ability to speak the truth in spite of danger or fear. Research Design: This is an analytic essay/theoretical argument. As a way of scaffolding the discussion, I incorporate vignettes of data collected from my research in high school civics classrooms. Of particular interest to this argument is Mr. Monroe, a teacher I studied during the 2012 Presidential Election. Conclusions/Recommendations: An analysis of teacher political disclosure using a parrhesia framework suggests that educators should rethink the conventional wisdom that supports non-disclosure. Although disclosure carries inherent risk, it also offers democratic and interpersonal benefits for students. Both in-service and pre-service professional development, then, should present teachers with a complete picture of the risks and benefits of disclosure, and teachers should determine whether to engage in parrhesiastic acts by strategically balancing those risks against the potential of disclosure to support their pedagogical goals.

AB  - We investigated the characteristics of early childhood education (ECE) preservice teachers (PSTs) who were identified as closed minded and their capacity to deal with controversial issues. We define open-mindedness as the willingness to consider experiences, beliefs, values, and perspectives that differ from one's own. First, we used quantitative surveys to identify PSTs with less open-minded thinking dispositions among those who responded (n = 84). Then, we selected and ultimately interviewed five participants who indicated that their religious views played a significant role in the way they developed their epistemological and ontological views. Interviews suggested that concepts of social justice and the common good were seen as inimical to their core religious beliefs. As such, some respondents avoided these ideas without sufficiently entertaining the complexity involved with their religious beliefs and democratic ideals. This study has numerous implications for the macrocurriculum of teacher education.

AB  - This instrumental case study of Generation Z preservice teachers enrolled in elementary teaching methods courses in social studies and literacy explores the impact of polarization on their political engagement and teaching. Using the 2020 presidential election as a teachable moment, participants developed and taught literacy-infused civics units in order to bring to light their understandings of their role in preparing elementary students as political actors. This study has important implications for how teacher educators can better facilitate elementary preservice teachers' own political engagement, thereby ensuring equitable democratic learning opportunities for students.
